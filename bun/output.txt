Memphis Sanitation Workers' Strike

Event February 12, 1968 to April 16, 1968

The night before his assassination in April 1968, Martin Luther King told a group of striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee: “We’ve got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end. Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis. We’ve got to see it through” (King, “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop,” 217). King believed the struggle in Memphis exposed the need for economic equality and social justice that he hoped his Poor People’s Campaign would highlight nationally.

On 1 February 1968, two Memphis garbage collectors, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, were crushed to death by a malfunctioning truck. Eleven days later, frustrated by the city’s response to the latest event in a long pattern of neglect and abuse of its black employees, 1,300 black men from the Memphis Department of Public Works went on strike. Sanitation workers, led by garbage-collector-turned-union-organizer T. O. Jones, and supported by the president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Jerry Wurf, demanded recognition of their union, better safety standards, and a decent wage.

The union, which had been granted a charter by AFSCME in 1964, had attempted a strike in 1966, but failed in large part because workers were unable to arouse the support of Memphis’ religious community or middle class. Conditions for black sanitation workers worsened when Henry Loeb became mayor in January 1968. Loeb refused to take dilapidated trucks out of service or pay overtime when men were forced to work late-night shifts. Sanitation workers earned wages so low that many were on welfare and hundreds relied on food stamps to feed their families.

On 11 February, more than 700 men attended a union meeting and unanimously decided to strike. Within a week, the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People passed a resolution supporting the strike. The strike might have ended on 22 February, when the City Council, pressured by a sit-in of sanitation workers and their supporters, voted to recognize the union and recommended a wage increase. Mayor Loeb rejected the City Council vote, however, insisting that only he had the authority to recognize the union and refused to do so.

The following day, after police used mace and tear gas against nonviolent demonstrators marching to City Hall, Memphis’ black community was galvanized. Meeting in a church basement on 24 February, 150 local ministers formed Community on the Move for Equality (COME), under the leadership of King’s longtime ally, local minister James Lawson. COME committed to the use of nonviolent civil disobedience to fill Memphis’ jails and bring attention to the plight of the sanitation workers. By the beginning of March, local high school and college students, nearly a quarter of them white, were participating alongside garbage workers in daily marches; and over 100 people, including several ministers, had been arrested.

While Lawson kept King updated by phone, other national civil rights leaders, including Roy Wilkins and Bayard Rustin, came to rally the sanitation workers. King himself arrived on 18 March to address a crowd of about 25,000—the largest indoor gathering the civil rights movement had ever seen. Speaking to a group of labor and civil rights activists and members of the powerful black church, King praised the group’s unity saying, “You are demonstrating that we can stick together. You are demonstrating that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that if one black person suffers, if one black person is down, we are all down” (King, 18 March 1968). King encouraged the group to support the sanitation strike by going on a citywide work stoppage, and he pledged to return that Friday, 22 March, to lead a protest through the city.

King left Memphis the following day, but Southern Christian Leaderships Conference’s (SCLC) James Bevel and Ralph Abernathy remained to help organize the protest and work stoppage. When the day arrived, however, a massive snowstorm blanketed the region, preventing King from reaching Memphis and causing the organizers to reschedule the march for 28 March. Memphis city officials estimated that 22,000 students skipped school that day to participate in the demonstration. King arrived late and found a massive crowd on the brink of chaos. Lawson and King led the march together but quickly called off the demonstration as violence began to erupt. King was whisked away to a nearby hotel, and Lawson told the mass of people to turn around and go back to the church. In the chaos that followed, downtown shops were looted, and a 16-year-old was shot and killed by a police officer. Police followed demonstrators back to the Clayborn Temple, entered the church, released tear gas inside the sanctuary, and clubbed people as they lay on the floor to get fresh air.

Loeb called for martial law and brought in 4,000 National Guard troops. The following day, over 200 striking workers continued their daily march, carrying signs that read, “I Am a Man” (Honey, 389). At a news conference held before he returned to Atlanta, King said that he had been unaware of the divisions within the community, particularly of the presence of a black youth group committed to “Black Power” called the Invaders, who were accused of starting the violence.

King considered not returning to Memphis, but decided that if the nonviolent struggle for economic justice was going to succeed it would be necessary to follow through with the movement there. After a divisive meeting on 30 March, SCLC staff agreed to support King’s return to Memphis. He arrived on 3 April and was persuaded to speak by a crowd of dedicated sanitation workers who had braved another storm to hear him. A weary King preached about his own mortality, telling the group, “Like anybody, I would like to live a long life—longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now … I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land” (King, “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop,” 222–223).

The following evening, as King was getting ready for dinner, he was shot and killed on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. While Lawson recorded a radio announcement urging calm in Memphis, Loeb called in the state police and the National Guard and ordered a 7 P.M. curfew. Black and white ministers pleaded with Loeb to concede to the union’s demands, but the mayor held firm. President Lyndon B. Johnson charged Undersecretary of Labor James Reynolds with negotiating a solution and ending the strike.

On 8 April, an estimated 42,000 people led by Coretta Scott King, SCLC, and union leaders silently marched through Memphis in honor of King, demanding that Loeb give in to the union’s requests. In front of City Hall, AFSCME pledged to support the workers until “we have justice” (Honey, 480). Negotiators finally reached a deal on 16 April, allowing the City Council to recognize the union and guaranteeing a better wage. Although the deal brought the strike to an end, several months later the union had to threaten another strike to press the city to follow through with its commitment.

I was told by everyone how there is a massive shortage of of trade workers these days (with a healthy sprinkle of "kids don't wanna work hard these days" obviously) . So here I am 2 years into my electrical apprenticeship and I totally get why no one wants to do this.

I have worked with 5 separate mechanics in my time and every one of them it's the same story. It's a old guy who's been doing this for years and forgets I just started and don't know what im doing. Instead of training me ( you know, like they are supposed to) I get screamed and yelled at for not understanding everything right off the bat. This is usually followed by a lengthy tirade about "back in my day when men really worked" and then more verbal abuse. I have been threatened with physical violence ( "you keep fucking up I'll beat your ass" ) and some good old fashioned reminiscing like " I remember when you could hit your apprentices, those where the good days".

Overall, 2 years in and I'm sick of this super macho old school mentality and feel like my progress in regards to actually learning the trade is going nowhere. I'm curious if I just have a unique skill in finding crappy places to work or if others in the trades have experienced similar things.

Edit: I'm truly overwhelmed by the response and it's good to know I'm not alone in this. Thank you everyone for the advice I will definitely try to see if this can be worked out. I will say that my situation is a bit complicated because the guy I work with is partial owner of the company so it makes "going above his head" a non possibility.

My family has a trip planned that will require me take off 1.5 days. I put in the request in March for this June trip and initially without looking at the PTO calendar my boss said “sure that should work”. My entire family got the time approved and booked the trip. She then told me too many people (2 people) in the company region are off that day, but since our store has been particularly slow lately she might be able to make it work but she wouldn’t know until a week before. So I held out hope until this week and she told me there’s no way for it to work. By the way, I’m an overachieving employee that bends over backward any chance I get to help the company. This family vacation is already booked. My family and I discussed it and we think I should just tell her “I won’t be in these days. We talk about a work/life balance all the time and this is it. When it comes between work or time with family, family will always win. I am willing to accept whatever disciplinary action is appropriate, but I will not be coming into work those days.”

Thoughts?

It’s insanely difficult to make money, I can barely fathom the competence, stress tolerance, and intelligence required for some of these $150,000+ jobs when it’s nearly impossible to even make $65,000.

How do people do it?

I have a masters and 10 years of experience and am struggling since a layoff on 3/31. I get interviews, but apparently companies are getting so many applicants it doesn't matter.

Anyone else feel this way? I last looked for a job unemployed during the great recession and not even that was this bad...

Constant ghosting, internal picked over me or no one hired and position still "open" months later.

Fuck this job market. The only jobs that exist are low pay trash jobs no one wants.

So I recently signed a job offer with a giant company and once I looked at my actual salary in the system it did not match my offer letter. I pointed this out to the HR department (supported with evidence in my offer letter) and basically they said that they made a mistake and my compensation is 20% lower! I don’t think I have the money or the patience to sue a giant multinational corporation. Nor do I stand a chance. My supervisor just sort of acts like we are all at the mercy of HR and it’s not like HE made the mistake. Plus I still want to work for them! It’s a well paying job even after the 20% cut. Anything I can do besides just take it?!

I work as a digital marketer and I have to work Monday-Friday, 9-5 in office. Yesterday I was sick, and since our boss is away and the second in command was out, I was allowed to work from home. The difference in quality of life is incredible. I signed into Canva on my computer, pulled up the company software and image database, logged into my email, and boom I was set for the day.

I worked a flawless day from the comfort of my own home. I was able to run to Petco to grab some supplies for my pets, run to get some lunch without feeling rushed, and eat peacefully in my kitchen instead of surrounded by phones ringing and customers walking around. Today I'm back in office surrounded by my annoying coworkers, having to deal with all their nonstop talking, loud sounds, pointless questions, and coffee making. I've been here for 50 minutes and I'm already way more miserable.

And it just begs the question, why do employers force employees who can easily do their job at home to come into the office all week? Seems nonsensical.

I was through a temp agency. I walked in on my boss watching porn and today they fired me. This happened a couple of weeks ago and I didn’t know what to do.

My mistake was confiding in 2 of my coworkers and asking them for advice on who I should go to. I decided to just bury the event and was later fired today and I guess they’ve been trying to replace me for awhile now.

I didn’t feel 100% comfortable after this event and am trying to look at this as a positive but just feel so shitty that they didn’t even get my side of the story or see if i was okay.

From what i hear they tried to say I was spreading rumors (i’m guessing the 2 coworkers i asked for advice spoke about it later on) but I just feel so sad that no one decided to see if i was okay, and why isn’t my boss getting reprimanded for literally watching porn in an open office in front of his employees.

edit: i also wanted to add i brought it up to my coworkers due to my boss shifting attitudes after i caught him. he was cold and dismissive and when i needed help or info he would avoid me or ignore me. So i asked them for advice on what i should do since ive never been in that situation before.

Not saying my actions were right i just wanted to give a little more context.

I had a hair drug test for a state job and I received a letter in the mail that said I failed. I have never even seen cocaine in real life let alone used it. I asked if I could see the results and was told that they don’t do that. I thought that since it would be considered medical records, I would be entitled to it. Because of this, I don’t believe that I failed. Does anyone know if I have any legal recourse or is there a reason that I would fail even though I have never used it?

My job isn't extravagant and the pay isn't great but after working in retail for 10 years I love working in an office.

I have my own cubicle to myself, I don't have managers hovering over me and micromanaging me all day. I have a set schedule every week which makes it so much easier to plan things. I know I'll have Saturday Sunday off every week and I never have to close again. I can go to the bathroom whenever I want for as long as I want, I can have coffee at my desk, or I can eat snacks at my desk. I can wear cute clothes to work instead of a uniform.

I know a lot of people hate the standard 9-5 job but I just wanted to give a different perspective. I feel like after working in retail for so long it really makes me appreciate it so much more.

Like the title suggests…. For background I’m currently in grad school because I want to work in education and get out of my current industry. So like many would guess, I’m pretty busy. With my 7-3 job, school work, and next term I’m fitting an internship in on the weekends at a local college.

The thing is, I haven’t told ANYONE that I’m even in school. The only people that knew-and were supposed to know, are my school, my fiancé and my therapist. So I found it kinda odd that my other coworker, let’s call her Joan sent me a Facebook message saying that HR is probably going to call me down because other coworker, let’s call her jackass reported me for “having outside employment without disclosure” and she apparently told everyone that I’m in school, and that I have an internship that starts soon, so I’m probably resigning and it’s “not fair to everyone else” even though my internship is on the weekends! …livid.

I had no idea how she could have possibly got that information, as I don’t do anything school related at work, nor did I ever talk about it on the phone or anything like that where she could have overheard. Up until this point I think I’ve done a pretty good job at keeping work and school totally separate. Well, I guess not..

It took a while for me to realize that I had left my planner in the top drawer of my desk the other day which has all of my school, work, and very personal information in it, and jackass stays later than I do, so she’d have ample time to snoop her nosey ass through it and what ever else after hours.

So now, not only am I probably going to get fired for something that isn’t even my employers business, but now my coworkers have a ton of my private information/goals/aspirations, even my menstrual cycle from my planner. I feel violated, screwed, and like I’m a total idiot.

Moral of the story: don’t ever trust that you’re coworkers don’t snoop through your private sh*t when you’re not there I guess.

UPDATE: Outside work - I’m taking the keep quiet approach, HR hasn’t approached me about it so I’m not approaching them. It states in the handbook that college, volunteer work, unpaid internships and research projects DO NOT count as outside employment and do not require approval.

My planner - I’m still thinking about how I want to approach this issue. There are no cameras that can visualize my desk, so unfortunately it’s going to be difficult to prove.

Skeleton Crews. Basically, if one person is doing the work of three people with the same pay why hire more? Who cares if that person is stressed out? Business is still running as usual and will hold out as long as they can. By not hiring more and keeping the headcount low, profit goes up and whoever is in the upper management gets a nice bonus.

False Hiring and PPP Loans. Ranging from small businesses to large corporations, many have received Payment Protection Program (PPP) Loans that were supposed to be used for payroll and other expenses during the pandemic. However, many of the loans were abused and pocketed by owners and then later forgiven. A condition for these loans to be forgiven is if a company is "actively" trying to hire but cannot fulfill these positions. That's why people are struggling to get interviews as well as seeing jobs being posted over and over again. They had no intention to hire in the first place. Basically, it was a huge money transfer and the top ate well.

Everyone is hiring. No, they are not. Only retail and fast food positions that barely pay a living wage and high stressed are only hiring is what they mean. Not the comfy white-collar jobs with good benefits cause who would give that up? Even then, these places are running on skeleton crews as well.

Mass Layoffs. You have now a lot of people including whom have more than 12+ years of experience looking for jobs now. A good chunk of them are willing to take lower-paying jobs because they have no choice but to put food on the table and pay bills. Now the entry-level or junior-level position you are applying for has become more competitive. Employers have the luxury to be picky and want a unicorn to be a yes man, a bootlicker, someone who does not talk back, who is overqualified, and willing to take a pay cut as well. Also, a lot of these companies have a "monkey see monkey do" mentality. Once a couple of companies started doing layoffs, then other companies started doing it only because "it must be the right thing to do right now"

The Feds actually want unemployment to go up. They want it to go up because the justification is that no job = no money = reduction in savings = lower purchasing power = reduction in inflation. Higher interest rates would lead more people to hold off on purchases they do not need which put less money in circulation and bring down inflation according to the federal government. Also, Powell said it is to "discipline labor" as well. But of course, there isn't a problem with corporations making record profits during high periods of inflation. It is estimated that 70% of inflation came from price gouging in which corporations raised the price more than they needed to and mask it as inflation. Anything but to tax the rich right? I'm sure trickle-down will happen anytime soon.

Anti- WFH Propaganda. Throughout the pandemic, multiple reports proved that WFH has increased productivity and worker well-being that has not been seen pre-pandemic. WFH was positively received. But all of a sudden Return-to-Office was necessary as WFH wasn't working even though as long you have a computer, desk, and WI-FI, the same work that can be done at the office, can be done better from home in most people's cases. This is later revealed that a lot of bigger players are tied up in real-estate investment of these corporate buildings and that tax revenue around the surrounding areas has decreased as well which the local government does not like. If you WFH, there is no need to buy food on the way to work or buy expensive lunch downtown, and then waste money on gas. However, with the big RTO push, a lot of employees are either resigning or outright refusing because why would you go backward on quality of life? I even was disqualified from an interview for asking about remote policy but it is what it is. Remote work is in hot demand yet employers refuse to acknowledge it.

There's more to why the job market is trash right now of course but this is JMO from all the reports and posts I have been reading. Feel free to add or even counter any of the points I made. Any comments are appreciated

I have a job interview and arrived on time. His staff told me he is running late, so I have been sitting alone in a back room for an hour.

Should I stay, try to reschedule, or just leave? Because this feels very unprofessional.

I’m 22, haven’t had many interviews before. Is this normal?

Update: just had the interview, this guy doesn’t apologize for being late, just tells me “thanks for waiting”.

He didn’t mention a single thing about the job, my pay, or even what I’d be doing. Then offers me the job immediately. I said no and left.

Edit: Wow this blew up like crazy! I see a lot of questions so I’ll try to answer some here.

Prior to this interview I had a zoom one with two ladies. They were both professional and respectful, which is the main reason I waited so long for this one.

I was already skeptical waiting, but decided to stick it through because I had already spent like 40 mins sitting there. After I met the guy, I immediately knew I didn’t want to work for him. That’s why I didn’t ask any questions about pay, hours, etc.

The interview in total lasted maybe 10 mins. He asked for my availability, and the basic “what are your skills, how can they apply here” type of questions. But that was really it, nothing about the actual job, pay, or what I’d be doing. He asked if I had any questions to which I said no. Then said they are looking to hire immediately and asked if I wanted the job.

Anyone else? Or do I just have a particularly bad attitude?

EDIT - Wow, I didn't expect my petty little complaint to get so many upvotes. I guess many of you found this relatable.

To those of you saying "why don't you only apply to companies you are passionate about?" I'm a GenXer, my generation has a good work ethic but mostly sees employment as a transactional relationship. It's extremely rare that I'm going to be passionate about any major corporation. They're not passionate about me, they'll lay my ass off in a heartbeat if it increases shareholder value.

This happened about a year ago. I was a fresh computer science graduate looking for my first job out of university. I already had a years experience as I did a 'year in industry' in London. I'd just had an offer for a London based job at £44k but didn't really want to work in London again, applied hoping it was a remote role but it wasn't.

Anyway, I see this job for a small company has been advertised for a while and decided to apply. In the next few days I get a phone call asking me to come in. When I pull into the small car park next to a few new build houses converted to offices, I pull up next to a gold plated BMW i8. Clearly the company is not doing badly.

Go through the normal interview stuff for about 15mins then get asked the dreaded question "what is your salary expectation?". I fumble around trying to not give exact figures. The CEO hates this and very bluntly tells me to name a figure. I say £35k. He laughed. I'm a little confused as this is the number listed on the advert. He proceeded to give a lecture on how much recruitment agencies inflate the price and warp graduates brains to expect higher salaries. I clearly didn't know my worth and I would be lucky to get a job with that salary. I was a bit taken aback by this and didn't really know how to react. So I ask how much he would be willing to pay me. After insulting my github portfolio saying I should only have working software on there he says £20k. At this point I get up, shake his hand, thank him for the time and end the interview.

I still get a formal offer in the form of a text message, minutes after me leaving. I reply that unfortunately I already have an offer for over double the salary offered so will not be considering them any further. It felt good.

Basically the title. It’s gross and I can smell it. Somtimes it’s pretty loud too like he isn’t hiding it. It’s so disturbing.

Background: I work as a programmer in tech. Our office has many programmers in cubicles next to one another. It’s a nice place and I like the job, bosses, and everyone.

We recently got a new programmer. There are other personality traits I don’t particularly favor, but they are tolerable and can be overlooked.

But the farting is really getting to me. It’s gross and seems to happen always at the end of the day when there are less people in the office. I’m directly behind him and I can hear and smell the farts.

I don’t know what to do, tell my boss? Confront him and ask if he could stop? LOL. It’s so weird I don’t even know how to approach it.

It’s comes to the point I just leave the room when he farts becuase why would I want to smell his farts.

This isn’t a joke post, I really don’t know what to do

I just sit in a desk for 8 hours, creating value for a company making my bosses and shareholders rich, I watch the clock numerous times a day, feel trapped in the matrix or the system, feel like I accomplish nothing and I get to nowhere, How can people survive this? Doing this 5 days a week for 30-40 years? there’s a way to overcome this ? Without antidepressants

Hi everyone! I don't have too many people I can talk about this with, so I just wanted to share the news with someone. I work in software, and my current pay is $75k per year. The short version of my past few years is that I dropped out of college and have been making $45k/ year for a while pre-COVID. From there, 2020 hit me really hard. I was unemployed for about 6 months. I was looking for $18/hour jobs, then I got an opportunity in software sales. I started at a base salary of $50k per year. I got promoted once and then moved over to operations within my company, and my salary went up to $75k (where it is now).

Having been at my current company for 3 years, I've known that I was underpaid compared to the market for a while, so I started looking a few months ago. I applied to this job that's a manager-level position, which is one level above my current role. I had my final round interview at this company last week and it went pretty well.

The hiring manager set some time with me yesterday afternoon. When we hopped on the call, we talked for a few minutes before she offered me the job! $120k per year! In the moment, I didn't react much outwardly or inwardly beyond being pleasant and expressing thankfulness and excitement about the offer. I was trying to keep my hand close to my vest I suppose. I ended up thanking her and agreeing to follow up on Monday after I had the weekend to think about it (as I was in the process of a few other interviews as well).

For the hour after we hopped off Zoom, I didn't feel much. Then the offer letter hit my inbox. Seeing $120,000 in black and white is when it hit me. $10,000/month. I broke down and started crying. That's more money than I've ever made before by a long shot. I wanted to call my dad and tell him because I know that he'd be proud. He died in 2020, so I got hit with a wave of emotions from excitement to relief, to grief hitting me super hard. I've had a lot of money stress over the past few years, and this feels like a game changer. I'm hoping that this will accelerate my ability to build up savings and I want to be smart with it.

Anyway, that's my ramble. Thanks for listening. Today I'm excited and am looking forward to accepting on Monday. I still wish I could call my dad up and tell him though; I know he'd be happy.

Edit: wow, I appreciate all the love! The positivity is really great to see.

Seriously, everyone needs to be fully aware of this. The majority of data does not support in office work vs remote work. Companies were the most profitable they have ever been during the pandemic. Yes, that was also caused by an endless supply of helicopter money, but also because worker engagement was up a ridiculous amount. For me personally, I have never worked as hard as I have during the last few years, and I am fully remote.

The REAL reason for all these stupid articles is the commercial real estate situation. Companies are losing money (on paper) because their real estate values have all declined. Forcing employees back to the office would create more demand for surrounding homes/businesses, and affectively raise their portfolio value.

The other reason is control. The C-Suites job is to "inspire". They don't feel a sense of purpose without having you, the worker bee, around for them to view. They want to see you building their pyramid for them, even if it can be done remotely and more efficiently. It's a psychological thing that sociopaths in the C-Suite need. They're losing control, and they want to have it back to be more valuable since their perceived value is about steering the ship and not contributing anything meaningful.

Just wanted to share and vent because I'm sick of this narrative. Remember the truth and ALWAYS bring it up.

EDIT: Wow...I didn't expect to get this many responses. I just wanted to add that yes, there is frustration in my voice. I'm tired. I'm tired of the constant squeeze corporations apply to all of us daily. It's always happened throughout history, but it is MUCH worse now. Profit over People has never been more rampant then it is now.

The truth is, I believe this country is in desperate need of a workers rights movement. I would LOVE to see every talented individual out there push back against this RTO narrative that is solely based off "a gut feeling" from a handful of people. I'm just tired of being lied to, and it's a constant fight to keep the truth alive.

Also, to everyone that is saying things like "suck it up and deal with it", you're part of the problem. That dismissive attitude means you aren't open to change, and just accept things the way they are. You can change anything you want in this world, you just have to get enough people to say "No".

Take care

Every. Single. Job.

Could be sticking labels on boxes in a rat infested warehouse.

• Educated to Bachelor degree level

???

For entry level positions… literally run of the mill administrative positions. To send emails they want you to have a marketing degree ?

What in the flying fu*k is going on.

Am I supposed to just cease to exist or take on 50K+ debt to never earn enough to pay it off but earn just enough to have it deducted from my pay every month???? Whilst the bar raises every year??? And so does the interest.

It was Age 16 level qualifications then Age 18. Now graduate level… next they’ll want you to have lectured for 10 years in finance at Harvard, Yale, Oxford and Cambridge, interned across 5 major global players and prevented economic disasters to input numbers on a fu*king spreadsheet.

Who’s writing up these person specifications? God?!!?!?!!!

Everyone in my career field that posts on Reddit tells me I’m “underpaid” yet when I go out and look for jobs and get offers it’s for amounts they say shouldn’t be happening. I make 60k almost 4 years after graduating college and they insist that’s way underpaid yet I only see the opposite in the real world.

I see people on here talking about making 150-200k and I don’t even understand how someone can offer you that much money.

I was laid off a few months ago (together with almost half the people in my company). I was a little bit in panic mode by then. During the first 2-3 months I applied to literally every single PM job offer I saw but I didn’t even pass the second interview. Then a friend explained to me the 3-stage process she used to find her job. She also recommended a few AI tools that ended up being very useful.

After 2 months of following her guidelines, I was offered 2 positions! 1 of them with a higher salary than the one I had in my previous company (ironically I took the other one, but for different reasons).
I learned that finding a new job is a job in itself. You improve with practice and by failing. So the 3-stage process is designed to iterate fast. In every stage, I focused on “Mastering that stage only” and improving on 1 metric:

Stage 1 Iterate my Resume

My main focus in this stage was to improve the conversion rate of my resume. The metric I used was the % of responses I received. I kept refining and tweaking my resume until I achieved a solid ratio. I started with less than a 5% response rate (from resume sent to first interview scheduled).

In a shell I did this:

Adapt my resume for every position (I used a few tools, mostly kickresume explained below).

When describing my previous experience, rephrase it using the exact key words used in the job offer. A lot of companies use software to filter resumes, so if they don’t find certain keywords, you are automatically rejected.

Create a cover letter “template” and leave some paragraphs to modify depending on each company.

I created a notion page with a more detailed resume, with links to previous projects and a lot of details about me. I added this when asked for a “Website URL” (asked in many offers).

Once I started getting first interviews with HR managers or hiring managers (1st interview), I shifted my attention to preparing and improving my interview skills.

Stage 2 First interviews (usually with HR)

In this stage, I aimed to increase the number of second interviews or technical exercises I was offered. This was a critical step in progressing further in the hiring process. I made sure to thoroughly prepare for these initial interviews, showcasing my skills and experiences effectively and I used a few tools (below) to practice my interviews.

You’ll be asked the same questions again and again in these interviews with HR. With Otter you can transcript the meetings. So I created a document with "Hard Questions in Job Interviews" as a quick reference during interviews. I have the answers written there for all the typical questions. If you do online meetings, you can keep the doc open on your second screen 😛

3 Use case (or technical exercise)

My metric here was the number of job offers I received. This stage varies a lot depending on your role. I was applying for Product Manager, in case you are also applying for this role let me know and I can give you some examples of exercises I prepared in advance

Here are the tools that played a significant role in that process:

1 ChatGPT - Turned into a job interview trainer

You start by training ChatGPT on your resume. You can use this prompt:

As ChatGPT, you’ll be participating in an interview simulation for the position of Product Manager at ____. I’ll provide you with your Resume in an upcoming message. Following that, you’ll receive the interview questions along with guidelines on how to respond.

Then you copy&Paste your CV on ChatGPT. And you give it this new prompt:

The focus of this interview will be on your soft skills. When answering questions be clear and concise, using everyday language. Create convincing responses that an interviewer would appreciate even if they are fictional. However, ensure that your answers align with the experiences mentioned in your resume.

Then ask ChatGPT the interview questions you may get and it will be generating perfect responses to any question.

2 kickresume.com

Use it to improve your resume. You can do several things with it. Start your resume from scratch or modify one, create your cover letter with AI (it uses ChatGPT on the backend), or ask for feedback on your resume. I still needed to do a lot of manual changes in the version it creates but it is a great start. For cover letters, which can be quite a hassle to customize for each job application, it was a real-time-saver. Another option is Rezi, I haven’t tried it yet but it looks promising.

3 Wave.ai

It provided a written conversation with a real human coach, utilizing AI to offer guidance and assistance. The coaching sessions helped me develop habits for finding the right jobs and mentally preparing for interviews. I used it a lot in stage 2. I would go to Wave with the answers I replied on every interview and they would help me improve them with feedback. Ultimately, they also helped me negotiate the offers. I’m so bad at facing conflict and asking for a higher salary, that my first instinct when I was offered the first job was to say OMG OF COURSE. I was able to raise the salary a bit and also the stock options they gave to me.

4 Otter.ai

You can use it during your online meetings to take notes. During job interviews, it is not only important the content of your answer, but also how your answer is structured. And the only way to improve this is by practicing. With this tool, I could review the questions asked and my responses, allowing me to refine and better structure my answers. Write down your answers and then use ChatGPT to improve them and structure them in a way that is easier to understand!

5 Interview Warmup (from Google)

Similar use to the first one with ChatGPT but in this case they ask you the questions. It simulates a real interview and gives you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve. Also, by practicing with these tools, I felt more confident and prepared for those higher-stakes real interviews.

I hope this is helpful to you!

Any other tool I should add?

Just wanted to post my achievement here. I’m going to jump from making ~$35k/year to ~$60k/year in a months’ time. Things are going to be okay.

I thought it was a red flag the first time it happened. That company actually ended up offering me a job, but I declined (there were numerous other red flags).

Then in an interview yesterday, the interviewer asked me if I lived with my parents. She then asked if I was interviewing with anyone and whether I’d declined any offers. I said I had. She asked why. I tried to give a non committal answer, but she kept pushing.

Are they even allowed to ask me these questions?? It always makes me uncomfortable, but I’m a recent grad and it’s my first time job hunting like this, so I’m not really sure.

Entry level game design job: Oops sorry but you need 5 years of AAA experience to work for our small indie company for 20 dollars an hour. It’s the bare minimum I can’t believe you don’t have that experience yet even though you didn’t even graduate college yet. Kids these days…

Very frustrating. Bloated searches

I still apply. Lol

It's ridiculous. I'm currently in contact with a recruiter who said they would send my resumes out to companies and get back to me if any want to interview me. Well, I got some jobs back.

Results:

Texas: An $18-$20/hr office admin job (no thanks)

Also Texas: A purchasing agent job for $20/hr (also no thanks)

Indianapolis: An inside sales position offering $40k-$45k depending on experience.

All of these jobs prefer having Japanese/English bilingual skills ON TOP OF the skills required to perform the jobs... for a measly $20/hr. No matter how bad I want to get out of the dumpsterfire that is Idaho right now I'm not going to pack up and leave only to end up in the exact same situation I'm currently in, and likely end up worse off. It makes no sense.

This is not the first time this has happened with recruiters. All I ask for is a livable wage. Doesn't happen. I'm not moving half-way across the country for $20/hr. It'd be cheaper to get a basic English teaching job in Japan and I'd save more money given the CoL over there too.

I don't know why I try with recruiters anymore. I think I'm done job shopping in the US and am honestly just going to go back to Japan at this point. At least over there I can actually save money on even $30k/year...

Rant - I started a job about 10 months ago with a "flexible" PTO policy. Essentially, I have unlimited time off, to use at my discretion, up to 2 weeks at a time. I understand the other arguments against these open-PTO policies but something else has become abundantly clear to me having been with this job for about a year now.

The problem is, my immediate teammates (there are 5 of us) NEVER take time off. So what ends up happening is, I am the "slacker" of the team. I do not hesitate to take a random Friday off if work is slow, and I plan to take whole weeks off for various trips and vacations coming up this summer and fall. All in all, I will probably take 4 weeks of total PTO this year.

I get my work done on time and am generally well-liked with the company and team, but I feel like an ass because in comparison to the rest of my teammates, I take a lot of time off. I want to be there for my team and pick up some of their work when they take their own time off, but they (as mentioned above) rarely or never take time off, so I have yet been able to prove my ability to be a good teammate. I speak with folks from other departments and they regularly take time off, sharing fun stories about the trips they've taken and the places they've seen - yet another thing I do not get to share with my team because they are too caught up working to speak about anything else besides work.

/end rant. I am not necessarily looking for any advice here, maybe just some affirmations or similar stories from other people with PTO policies like this. This too could also be used as a point of consideration for anyone weighing the pros/cons of 2 jobs with different PTO policies, I guess.

Very fortunately, I got an internship with a large company my senior year of college. My interview for this position was 11 minutes long. Now, I’m sure there were some preconceived notions about me that the employer had, but still an 11 minute interview.

I got hired on full-time for this company after graduation, so I did not need to interview at all. Fast forward some months, a chunk of the marketing team is wiped and a bunch of us are jobless at the beginning of 2023.

Again, fortunately I get a new job that was recommended to me by a connection. This interview was a quick phone interview, and then an in person interview that was max 20 minutes.

Now, I hate this job. It pays the bills, but everyone here hates one specific person that cannot be fired due to them being a family member of the owner (this is a very small company). I just can’t take it anymore and there’s no benefits so it doesn’t feel worth my distress. Only good thing is that it’s the same salary as my previous job.

I’ve been applying to jobs, getting the typical ghosting and rejection emails at 12am from being filtered out by a computer. I encountered something weird today. I got kicked off the candidate list during a second round interview as a no-show. However, they scheduled a time that was outside of my given availability, and I told them twice before the interview that I could not make that time and they just ignored my emails. They asked me to reapply, which NO I AM NOT.

Why is hiring so WEIRD right now?

First off I want to thank everyone for their advice. It was extremely helpful to have others chime in to validate that this whole situation was extremely odd and inappropriate. It made made me feel confident that I could put a boundary in place that my safety was non negotiable.

Now on to what happened next-Like I said in my previous post I stated I felt unsafe to the owner, they then replied that they could get me a ride to their home (costing close to $200 which gets rid of the theory they didn’t want to rent a space due to money concerns). I declined the ride and then repeated my concern about safety going to their home and asked if we could do the training remotely or if we could meet in a public space where I could possibly bring someone. I thought this would make them second guess their behavior because surely any rational person wouldn’t want to make a potential employee feel unsafe?

NOPE that’s not how this went. They sent me long email back telling me that essentially the only way I could have this job is if I go to the owners house. They stated that they cannot hold meetings anywhere but their house due to “information privacy” concerns (please keep in mind this is not a government job or anything where sensitive confidential information would be exchanged). They then went on to say that I could absolutely NOT bring anyone. So bottom line-I would have to show up to their home, alone. The kicker is they then stated that they’re second guessing me as a candidate because I voiced these concerns and they only want “likeminded” “collaborative” employees…

Moral of the story is listen to your gut and stay safe when searching for jobs. I’m not sure what is going on here but I’m happy that I didn’t go. I’m not sure if I should reach out to the job posting site that I originally applied on to let them know about this. I just don’t want anyone else to end up in an unsafe situation because they need a job.
Thanks again everyone!!

I used to respond to all emails. Complete every task by its deadline. Work late into the night to do so. Now I find myself doing the 9 to 5 and not caring about what doesn’t get done during that time

Supervisors know I am overwhelmed. Im no longer fussed by deadlines.

I feel like something broke in me and Im a totally different work/person. I used to care so much. Im so done.

Is this normal? A sign of burnout?

My boss said to me today, " (My name), thank you for always making me smile and laugh. You are a bright spot to the day."

I work from home. So, all of our communications for my company and team are done through Microsoft Teams Chat. Honestly, working from home has been a huge boost to my career development.

For some reason, I feel so much more confident when people aren't staring at me in person. Honestly, that extra confidence makes me really want to help others and put smiles on their faces.

I guess my boss noticed. I didn't know people actually enjoyed the things I said. I figured they just thought I was a weirdo. That's how most people think of me anyway.

Autism comes with its challenges. The world doesn't see me in the ways that I wish it would. Hearing this from my boss really made my day.

Socializing doesn't come naturally for me. But when I work from home, I don't have to think about it nearly as much as I do when I'm in person. It's such a relief.

Studies have shown that frequent use of LinkedIn is associated with increased depression and anxiety.

LinkedIn really creates that fear of missing out. You feel pressurised to post something in case you’re forgotten and it’s just not sustainable IMHO.

Plus there is so much content that can have a negative impact on your mental health including:

Toxic positivity posts

Humble brags

Look at me selfies

Vanity metric showoffs

Burnout braggers etc

And spending too much time on LinkedIn isn't good for your mental health either.

Don't become a LinkedIn addict. Get a life!

And if you need a break, have one. You don't need to justify yourself either.

Please put your mental health first:

Post when you can

Build a supportive network

Cultivate a feel-good feed

How does LinkedIn make you feel?

The closest factory with decent pay that was hiring was doc Johnson dildo factory. Pay started at $20 an hour with good health care benefits.

I'm what you call the dildo dipper, after the dildos are made, it goes down the line where I dip the tip of the dildos on red paint and move it down the line. Then on the weekend I do quality control for overtime and I inspect and make sure the dildos are in great shape. It's a fun job

How does one react when your boss yells, screams and swears at you in a red faced anger?

Yes, the typical response is to walk away or quit on the spot. That would not work in my case. I now only have 9 months to survive at this job before I am eligible for a full pension of about $70K a year. If I leave before that date or am fired my pension will be cut by 2/3rds. Also I could not walk away because he blocked the path to the door.

I have tried to be super polite, work twice as hard and keep my head down but that just gets him angrier, so more yelling and screaming.

The boss wants me to quit and is trying hard to find a reason to fire me but he was told to stand down after my lawyer worked with the senior management at the parent company. Now he is trying to unnerve me and psyche me out so I quit. Physiological warfare!

His boss and the local HR Director are of no help and senior management at our small office want me gone too. The only thing helping me survive now is an effective Attorney who helped me submit a formal workplace grievance and oversight by the main corporate office Vice President of HR.

What would you do if you were in my shoes?

I had 4 calls this past week thaat made me MAD 😡 From 3 different companies

So if I ask for a hike that they promised in the Ad- They are shocked

Edit to add context: the job said X on the listing and on call they said, the max we can offer is X minus 50% .. We just put X cause that's the range in the market

If I say I would like to work within 90 minutes one way.of commute they are shocked

Edit to add context: literally it was beyond city limits. The company listing said City A , and the role was based on the outskirts of City A and B .

If I say I won't interview if I don't have a proper Job Description they are shocked

Edit to add context: He actually said, come in for the interview then we will discuss the role...the "Role is based on your experience (( I'm in Supply chain, and roles differ wildly based on product and service or which part of the chain you sit in (Ops, Quality, procurement etc) ))

If I don't make myself available for an interview within an hour as per their convenience they are shocked

Edit to add context: I was in office, recruiter calls for a zoom meeting in an hour, I tell him I can I'm at work, he's literally like " why can't you be available go into a conference room or something " like BITCH I am at my JOB

And then these same companies leaders put up LinkedIn posts on how they're fighting a War to get Talent in ..

YouTube video

Basically title.

I destroyed a piece of machinery by using it improperly. I've only been at my current workplace for 3 months, and had about a year of experience in this specific field. Though i have 5 years experience in immediately adjacent fields. I'm the most junior person on the team (25m), and i was shown how to use this thing on day one. I've used it wrong every time since then. I wasn't sure if i was using it wrong or not, and i repeatedly asked for guidance on it, but whenever i did the answer was always along the lines of, "well that is technically wrong, but i do it like that all the time, I wouldn't worry about it."

Well using it improperly as i had been, combined with some stars aligning outside of my immediate control, resulted in the complete and utter destruction of this machine. total loss, completely unrecoverable. No one was hurt, but everyone in the shop got hell of an adrenaline drop, it was pretty violent.

Justifiably, the CEO of the company want to meet with the whole crew in person. No one here has even met the CEO in person, all we know is that he has 70 years old, and has 50 years experience doing what we do, and is actually bit of a local legend, both for his sheer competency, and his epic temper. (although he has significantly mellowed out, if rumors hold true)

I'm really scared what he's going to say, i don't want to lose this job, its definitely the best I've ever had. Im just looking for some advice on what i can say that will let me thread the needle of keeping this job and not just blaming everyone but myself.

I’m in charge of hiring engineers for my division. We made an offer last week with an exchange that went something like this:

Us: Great interview, team likes you. How about a base salary of 112k plus benefits?

Them: oh jeez that sounds good but I was really hoping for 120k.

Us: how about 116k and when you get your license (should be within a 12 months or less) automatic 5k bump?

Them: sounds great

I prep offer, get it approved and sent out the next day.

Them: hey I was thinking I’d rather have 121k.

That isn’t how you negotiate! The key time to negotiate was before we had settled on a number- coming back higher after that just irritates everyone involved. Or am I off base?

Last week, I and quite a few other people tried to WFH because we were ill. We were told to take PTO or come in. Well, the sickness has spread and now too many people are sick and if they all took PTO our company literally wouldn't be able to function.

My boss told the 3 team members who are sick on my team to WFH this week since she sits by them and doesn't want to get sick (but also because if they all took off then the company would shut down). I should note that we are hybrid and everyone has the setup at home to WFH, there is absolutely no reason why anyone would actually need to come in while sick.

Maybe if they just let sick people WFH in the first place we wouldn't be dealing with the entire office being sick!

I just had the absolute worst interview with a CEO and I'm mortified. I expected to be asked about myself, my background, what I could bring to the company: instead I was shamed and asked about why I'm out of college for a year with no job. Why my internship didn't hire me. What my issue is and if I'm not trying hard enough. I'm absolutely crushed. I had amazing conversations with the previous three people I talked to, who were super interested in my art and what I could do.

Do they not understand it's people like them that cause this? If someone gave me a chance I wouldn't be in this situation with a resume gap. I've applied to over 400 places, made it to the final interview dozens of times, been flown out once and even got a job offer. I've been absolutely busting my ass and doing everything in my power. And to have a freaking CEO tear that all to the ground hurts so, so much. He didn't even give me a chance to explain myself or my skills, instead just said how he doesn't know if I can handle moving away from home and having a full-time job since I've lived with my parents for a year. As if I want to. I'm a freaking ADULT and I've been doing everything in my power to get a full-time job, it's all I want. I had a list of like 14 questions prepared and after I asked the first one he just was like "okay well thanks we have a lot of other good candidates bye"

Sorry for the rant. I'm just so completely crushed. I've never had an interview go by so quickly and so rudely that I'm actually thinking of talking to the HM. Has anyone had a similar experience?

So, after around 100 job applications, 12/13 interviews and 5 months without a paycheque and extreme mental stress, I’ve been offered a brilliant job today with a brilliant company

I just wanted to post this because I know it’s cliche, but for anyone else going through a stressful time with unemployment or a job hunt in general, please keep going - it’s the only way and you will get there in the end

No matter how difficult things are, if you’ve gotten one job before, you can definitely do it again. We all just need a bit of luck on our side ☺️

Wishing everyone the best of luck in finding the careers they want!

EDIT: I wasn’t expecting this post to do so well and receive so many congratulatory message from everyone!

Thank you to everyone again, and thank you to everyone I haven’t responded to saying thanks. I have tried, but there’s just too many of you 😆❤️

Hi everyone, i lied to HR about my salary inflated salary by 50% for what receive right now. Now HR is asking me to produce salary slip to verify my payment. I paid below standards of the market rate. So telling the true amount will make them take advantage of my situation and underpay me. What should i do please help

I have always had a job and the last two were careers. I was a employee and business owner of 15 years that employed 12-16 employees in the restaurant bar industry. I recently left CDCR after 8 years as I had family issues with elderly parents arise and needed a change. I know have been applying to jobs of indeed here in California with no luck. I have found that if I find a posting but go to the actually company website I can apply and actually get an interview. That being said after the interviews I get ghosted or the dreaded “We have moved on in the hiring process” rejection email. I have applied to a private for profit Nursing school as an attempt to get into a stabile career that I could possibly use to enhance my current retirement savings and work in as my last career. I am nuts, doing something wrong, or under estimating what really going on in the job market? Or is it me? I keep hearing that the workforce is lacking qualified workers, but I can’t even get an entry level job after 5 months!

For context I have an invisible chronic illness which heavily restricts my ability to most things. I'm a 25 yo woman so I almost always get the "but you don't look ill" stare whenever I mention I'm disabled. I have tried working 20-25 hours a week before and it has not been sustainable.

I have applied and been interviewed for quite a few jobs in the last 6(ish) months, each advertised as 12-16 hours per week. In each of these interviews I have been asked what my other commitments are/why I'm applying for part time work and I have been honest and said that I have a chronic illness which restricts my availability. Each time I've gotten "the stare" from the interviewer and I have rarely even got a reply from them regarding my interview. All of these jobs are basic retail jobs that I am more than qualified for.

How can I answer these types of questions without jeopardising my chances by mentioning my disability?

EDIT: thank you for all the responses! My biggest fear/issue is that when filling out paperwork at the interview stage, employers give out a timetable for a week (monday morning, afternoon, evening etc) and ask to tick when I'm available. Of course, I could work at any time or day, but not more than the part time hours. I worry that employers will see that I'm available and expect me to be able to work whenever they need. My previous retail jobs have done the same. I think I need to overcome the anxiety I get when I'm asked and learn to be more stern with my answers

I stumbled across this channel and read some of the posts and it occurred to me that there are a lot of questions and opinions being floated but I haven't seen any actionable advice. I have seen some bad advice.

First: Who am I? I work these days in technology but I've been a carpenter, I've worked in the marine industry as a boat captain and various scut work jobs, Ive been a graphic designer, and I have been a Product Management leader for 25+ years with VP, SVP and CPO titles. I've worked at huge companies, mid-sized companies and I've founded four companies, two of which I was the CEO.

So at the risk of pontificating, I thought I'd share some thoughts:

First: People are looking for coworkers - meaning people who they like, who are at the same level of competence as the rest of the team (not experience), who get things done, who are reliable, and who are creative problem solvers. Even at unsophisticated jobs, being a creative problem solver is a huge plus. You have to come across as likable. And ideally you want the interviewer to start rooting for you to be successful.

So how do you do that? You have to arrive at an interview ready to tell stories that capture the interviewer's attention and illustrate your value. Most interviewers are not good at interviewing, so you need to help them along.

These days I screen for 4 things when I hire. I believe these things are universally desirable and necessary in order to be successful at any job: Grit, Integrity, Empathy and Creativity.

I believe that if you can exhibit and illustrate these four traits in an interview, you have a much better chance of being hired. So what do these things mean, and how do you illustrate them?

Grit: this is the ability to get a task or project done, even if you run into obstacles. You need to illustrate that you have initiative, that you can identify and solve problems that are blocking you (sometimes this means asking for help, especially if you're junior), but mostly it means you keep on trying even if things get hard.

So have a story queued up that you can use to illustrate your grit. Tell a story about a really hard problem you had to solve. Summarize the background, explain what obstacles you ran into, and how you solved them. For a first job or if you're junior (1-3 years) telling a story that isn't work related is okay. Or a situation where you recognized a problem beyond your skill level and escalated to get help from your boss or a senior colleague, and then completed the project. Sometimes showing that you're a team player and that you have the humility to ask for help is better than struggling alone. However, if you're more senior, showing that you know how to get things done independently is probably more important.

2. Integrity: Are you trustworthy and reliable? Illustrate that you have integrity by telling about a time you had a moral or ethical quandary and had to make the hard decision to do the right thing. Or if you're brave, a time you did the wrong thing but learned from that failure. To be clear, I'm not talking about a time you made a mistake, I'm talking about the time you failed, the time you did the wrong thing, you knew it, you made the decision, and faced some consequences. Of course it's important that if you go down that path that your focus is on what you learned and why you won't make that mistake again. This can be really important if you have anything in your background that could become visible through a simple social media search or background check. Showing vulnerability in an interview, especially around integrity, can be the thing that gets an interviewer to start rooting for your success.

3. Empathy: This is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, walk around, see things from their perspective, and make decisions based on that insight. I would tell a story about a time when you struggled to work with someone else, perhaps you didn't even like that person, perhaps you disliked that person. But then you suddenly had an insight into why they were acting the way they were, or what was driving them, you developed a sense of empathy for them, and were able to work through the issues. Maybe you forged a great relationship, or maybe you just found a way to get by with a difficult coworker. Either way this will illustrate empathy and the ability to collaborate with people even if they are difficult.

4. Creativity: This one is a bit trickier. When I interview candidates, I ask a question designed to elicit a story about creativity. So be careful about how you interject this in the conversation. Tell a story about a time you figured out a solution to something difficult in a creative way, maybe talking about a business you started, even something as simple as a lawnmowing business as a kid or a project you did at church or a summer project. I ask the person to tell me an idea they've had for a company or a product or a nonprofit or service and what is exciting about it to them. Then I ask them to think through several aspects of the idea and expand on it until they finally either prove that they can think things through and to end, or they run into a wall at some point. Either way, it's very illuminating as an interviewer.

I hope this is helpful. Just remember, hiring managers are looking for team members. They're figuring out if they like you as well as if you're qualified. So it's really important that you let them look at you, the real you, so they can assess you for who you actually are. I've Filled people out of an interview process because they were too guarded and weren't letting me get to know them.

One last thing. As much as you are being interviewed, you should be interviewing them. Show up with good questions, do research about the company before you show up, and have a good reason for why you want to work there. If you discover that you don't like the people interviewing you , find out if they are someone you will have to work with every day or if they are not someone you will work with every day. It may not be worth it to take the job if you don't like the people.

6 months and counting here.

I've done everything you're supposed to do. I have a (supposedly) competitive MSc from a (supposedly) top uni. I have technical skills. I have internships with big names on my CV and good references. I speak languages. I know people. I apply left and right. I use keywords. I have a CV that's been professionally reviewed. I engage with people on LinkedIn. Job searching is a full time job by this point. And still I have nothing to show for it.

It's completely soul shattering. I have no money and no savings left. My friends and acquintances have a life, do things, get married, make plans, give birth to kids, start mortgages, book trips. I can't do anything, because I don't have money and I am depressed because I feel like I have no future. And it's a self growing vicious feedback loop: I get constant rejections, so I get depressed, so I don't even bother applying because I will get rejected anyways, so I don't progress, so I get even more depressed.

I spend every waking minute waiting for that email that could turn things around. Days go by painfully slowly. Some hiring manager that will care about me and give me a chance. But it never happens. And when Friday afternoon comes I get that oppressing sense of dread that comes from knowing yet another week has passed and now it's the weekend and no one will reply anyways, and then Monday will come and another week will pass and so on and so forth. It's a torture. It's exhausting.

I am at the end of my rope. Not only I cannot find a skilled job, but I won't get considered for an unskilled one because I'm too old and qualified - not that a random unskilled job would help matters anyway since I'd barely have money to feed myself (my mom has to pay for my food right now) and I still wouldn't be building anything resembling a future and a career for myself, so I'd still be in the same place as I am now.

I have studied for years and went repeatedly out of my comfort zone and now this.

I've had an actual disease in the past. I still felt better than I feel now. At least I had something to be positive about. I had hope it would end. I knew that if I followed medical advice I'd come out the other side. Now it's out of my control. I can't control hiring managers deciding on a whim against advancing me to the next stage. I can't control the fact that even if I do a great interview there might still be something that I do worse than someone else. I cannot control the fact that each time there might be even just one single applicant who's slightly better than me. I can't control anything. I can't do anything.

I just quit a job at a retail pharmacy because of how toxic my manager was. It was so disorganized. The drink coolers are full of mold and I also had been out for about a month because of surgery and recovery. My manager harassed me every week asking when I was returning. She said she “wasn’t” aware I submitted FMLA (Family medical leave act) but when I resubmitted it she got an email and questioned me about it? She’s narcissistic and loves to throw things in your face. I let her know I may be calling off work more often due to my surgery and the unpredictability of when I’m not feeling well. Last week I got so sick to the point I was throwing up and she had the nerve to tell me not to call off because she has plans. After I quit she kept saying I ruined her plans and not once during my recovery did she even check on me to see if I was ok. I stayed longer than I should have. I filed a complaint against her and I’m encouraging my coworker to do the same since she’s made racist remarks towards him (he’s black, shes white)

Our office is small. 7 people small, now 6. Last Tuesday I witnessed my coworker suffer from a ruptured brain aneurysm in my managers office. I called 911. Everyone was panicking. It was traumatic to say the least.

It was horrible and I keep replaying it in my head. I haven’t been back to the office but we will return Monday. I’m sure time will soften the pain, but I’m afraid our happy workplace will be very difficult for a while.

My boss and manager say that I can take all the time I need to process it/ get help/therapy. I’m not sure what advice I’m looking for but has this happened to anyone else? I’m afraid I won’t be able to concentrate, and keep picturing the incident of her seizing on the floor. Being wheeled out. Hearing the moans and the scared calls for help from my manager. Feeling the heavy emptiness of the cubicle beside me sounds very overwhelming right now.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. I am calling my therapist and will set up emdr as soon as I can get in. Work does offer an employee assistance program as well. For some reason I thought I could just shake it away and not think about it but professional help is needed.

I think I just needed validation that is was traumatic (duh should be obvious) but I’m just in shock I think.

Thank you

I work at a bank. I had a customer come in today already sporting and attitude. She threw her card at me and asked if her overdraft was available. After checking her account it was not available as our back office took it off her account. I told her that they had not reinstated her overdraft just yet. I held her card out to her as I was telling her for her to take it back. Once I finished my sentence she slammed her hand down on my wrist which in turn slammed my hand down on the table, grabbed her card from me and started yelling at me. My knuckles were red from slamming into our counter and my wrist was red with a mark from where she hit me. It wasn't as hard as she could have done it but hard enough to hurt. My manager watched the situation play out. She did not talk to the customer, close their account or even make a report about it. Do I need to report it to HR? I don't think I should go into work and be hit for anything. My manager said she isn't reporting it because "the customer probably wont come back when I'm there anyway, so there's no point." This doesn't feel right to me. Do I report it?

I went through three phone screenings and finally landed an on site interview with a beverage company in my area. I was expected to stay all morning since I was scheduled to meet with three people. I get there at 9:00am, the HR rep brings me to a conference room, talks to me for about 15 minutes, and leaves saying next person will be in at 9:30am. Ok, awkward but fine. Maybe it’s a test. Nobody ever came. I called the HR rep at 9:45am and the call went right to voice mail. I left a message. The person who was suppose to be there at 10:00am and the person scheduled for 10:30am never came either. During that period I left the HR rep two more voice mails. I finally left and much to my amazement the HR rep calls me at 2:00pm asking me how the interview went. I was a bit aggravated since I took the day off my current job since this seemed like a cool company, so I told her exactly how it went. Guess I won’t be hearing back from them.

After five long years in retail, I finally got the job offer of my current dreams. A big girl, full time, weekends and holidays off, paid traveling, three days in office, two days at home, and with great benefits job. I did three interviews and was let known today that I was selected. I cannot wait for this new chapter of my life. To those actively searching, best of luck and keep on to the hope! The job is out there and manifestation along with perseverance is powerful.

I started this job about 6 months ago. The company I work for still uses a lot of old software and processes to for their day-to-day task. After about 3 months I started to look into RPA’s and other low code programs like power automate to automate some of my work. I started out with just sending out a daily email based on whether or not an invoice had been paid and now nearly my entire job is automated. There’s a few things I still have to do on my own, but that only takes an hour of the day and I do them first thing in the morning. No one in my company realizes that I’ve done this and I don’t plan on telling them either. So I’ve been kicking about on Netflix and keep an eye on my teams and outlook messages on my phone.

To anyone wondering or second guessing if they should start working at Amazon, don’t go. ESPECIALLY during the holidays. They just hit me with mandatory overtime, 12 hours A DAY FOR 5 DAYS. On your feet at all times, and they have no sympathy nor empathy for you. If you can handle that by all means go, but if you can’t or just don’t want to be physically torn down, you please please don’t go. I’m only going bc I’m in a bad financial situation, but even then, there are better alternatives. Please heed my warning. Please.

I’m new at this job and was told that employees needed to give 30 dollars for a gift for the doctors. I work in a busy dental office. i gave 20 dollars because I genuinely can’t afford this and didn’t really want to. then, my boss literally said she could take the other 10 dollars at a later date. yeah, no. i’m not making payments to buy someone i don’t even know a gift and probably won’t be thanked for it. i don’t know these people? it’s not like these people are going to give me anything. idk it’s weird. sorry, 20 is what you’re gonna get cause that’s all i had. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Entered this company a year ago as an office allrounder. From moment one I was overwhelmed with work. Most months I did 20-30 hours of overtime because there was so much work (all-in contract so no overtime payment). Several times I told my superior that I needed a colleague to help me.

This was frequently ignored and more work dumped on me. It was always claimed that I didnt have so much to do and that getting x done requires just one email - getting y done requires just half an hour. Two weeks ago I was fired because "I didnt do enough work and it wasnt thorough enough"....

Now guess who has been trying to reach me for the past few days? My old a-hole boss. Turns out I was the only one doing like 5 important tasks that no one else had a clue about. They now want my contacts and work progress reports etc.

Of course I wont respond - but its comical how they just fired me - and now they realized that I have been doing important stuff. That I was the only on doing this important stuff.

Bosses/companies have absolutely no idea what their employees are doing huh?

It’s funny, I had a shower thought this morning. Some Indeed posts for very basic jobs require prior experience with specific software. I’m not talking about experience with Excel or Salesforce. I’m talking experience with software in a niche industry. For example, I apply to a lot of general clerical positions in healthcare. They want someone with YEARS of prior use in a particular optical-specific program used only in optometry offices, etc. Same goes for other smaller practices/offices.

I know usually those are not difficult to learn. The most basic 2 week training is all that’s required to learn all these programs. I know because I’ve managed to learn many of them quickly for different jobs. You don’t need to be a genius to catch on, especially if applying for an entry level position.

Seeing these ridiculous requirements makes me laugh and makes me think of employers who claim “no one wants to work anymore”. I can say the same thing for employers - none want to train anymore. Not even a measly 2 weeks.

So sick of posting after posting paying $18 an hour with several years experience required. Get out of here with that. No one is going to invest in applying to your job posting filling out an outdated application form, if you don’t invest in new hires.

Just got notice that Farmers Insurance is letting go of 11%, 2400 people this morning.

and yippee, I am one of them. fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucckkkkkkkkkkkk

This has happened to me probably a dozen times now and it baffles. A potential employers will go through the interview process, it'll seem to go really well, but then they let me know that they went with someone else. Whatever, that's life. They say they'll keep me on file for consideration in the future. Great, maybe the other choice won't work out. Then boom, a week later or a month later, the same position is reposted by the same company. If they didn't feel it was a good fit, why not just say that it wasn't a good fit? Why lie and pretend that you have some stockpile of qualified candidates to call back when you're just gonna go to the job boards every other week looking for fresh meat? No, seriously? Can anyone shed some light on this practice?

I’m 25, and wasted my previous years working BS fastfood/retail jobs. I’m trying to start a career in the blue collar field, but every time I mention I have no experience. They never hire me.

I’ve been looking forward to this interview and desperately need a job but just found out all the main players are Scientologists. The position advertised is open bc the previous employee is headed to LA to devote themselves to the “cause”. This has all been relayed to me through third parties. Nothing in their mission statement strikes me as a red flag but this is bad, right?

**Update: I canceled the interview. ETA: Thank you everyone for scaring the ever living shit outta me. I appreciate the clarity.

I'm currently in a business development role where its constant work and stress, KPIs, and out bounding and training.

I (24m) would like to find some sort of relaxed job where I don't feel threatened to lose my job every week (have had that threatened to me in first few months).

I'm not a lazy person, but I've had over 12 jobs since I was 14, I'm just tired.

Also I have side business ideas that I've worked on recently and would love to start carry on making music and documentaries, my social media has gotten some attention, and it's something I enjoy.

I've nearly doubled every sales target for the past 6 months of working, but deep inside I'm creative, love helping people live a better life, and would love to change the world around me more. I'd love to find something hybrid remote that I can be half office and half using my hands and body/strength. I don't enjoy the trades.

I'd also like to get a stable work as Id like to work on starting a family with someone. And I don't want the stress of a fickle stressful job that I would pass that stress and unavailability on.

So the company I work at is basically overloading me with work. They give me a lottt of work to complete in very little time. The pay is average as well. So my company basically finds rich business men from first world countries and then offer them VA services. And for that they hire us (people from third world countries) so that they can pay us peanuts of what the clients have paid them.

Anyways, I was on a video call with one of our clients and he started asking me personal questions about my salary. To which I told how much I'm being paid. He got surprised that I'm being paid 4 to 6 times less than what he is paying the company for my service. So he offered that I should leave my job and directly work for him. He is a great person otherwise and Im really tempted too now.

I'm just confused and cant stop feeling bad that if I accept his offer, I'd be basically betraying my company. Am I right to feel this way?

Update: guys I'm actually crying, thank you so much for your advises!! I have asked the client to send me a proper email stating my job SOP's including my pay and everything else. THANK U SO MUCH EVERYONE 🌟

So I'm officially employed as a sales rep on $47k/year, but I've been doing the responsibilities and tasks of the sales manager AND operations manager all year. Both of these official positions have technically been available, but my boss just hasn't bothered hiring for them. I recently got a new job that I start in 2 weeks, which is going to pay me just over $99k/year with additional benefits and allowances. The day after I resigned last week, my boss came at me with the "official" promotion to the role I'm doing - $55K. I declined, obviously. He seemed shocked, told me that the money shouldn't be a factor, that I've built up such a great reputation here I'd be throwing my "career" away (I've been there for less than 2 years). I told him that it's insulting at this point, and that if he had offered me the position a few months ago I wouldn't have started job searching and would've been elated. I advised him to reward people when it's due, not when you're going to lose them. Now as a result, the location I work at is going to be shut down because he can't find anyone to replace me and the other managers are leaving with me. Karma is sweet.

Managament in a restuarnt. Bringing home 1k a week. Im 19 dawg. Im happy but damn. Im so nervous. I have extreme social anxiety. They wanted me because they "needed more men to fulfill the role" ive worked many jobs in my past. So im not exactly new to this... any tips to deal with people? Or how to fake confidence properly?

For the past couple of years, I have been working at various galleries, and back in the day I used to think of it as a dream job. That was until I realized, that no one cares for the artists or art itself. Employees, as much as visitors just care about their fanciness, showing off their brand shoes and pretending as they actually care.

Ultimately, it comes down to sales, money, and judging people by their looks. Fishing out the ones, who seem like they can afford a painting worth 20k.

Was wondering if others had similar experiences

I'm just wondering, What else would you do if you don't have to worry about going to work or earning money?

I was told that you can come at any time during working hours for the interview. I went there at 2 Pm and filled the biodata form. I was told to wait for a few minutes. Then after tew minutes they told me that the HR and the MD are in a meeting and I will be called after the meeting. It's been more than 3 hours I am waiting and the receptionist occasionally comes and tells me that I will be called soon. What shall I do?

Update

The interview happened after 4 hours of waiting. It lasted only for 5 minutes. Interviewer asked whether I know Tally (an erp software). I said yes. Then he said the senior employee who know Tally has left the office as working hours have ended. He asked whether I will be able to come next monday so that I can be tested for my Tally knowledge. I said yes But I won't be going there anyway. If they call me, I will say I'll be coming but won't go there.

Essentially the title. I was laid off from a fully remote job about a month ago, and as we all might know, the job market is completely different from last year. So I received an offer for a senior position that was discussed during the hiring process and subsequent salary negotiation as being 3 days in office, which is not ideal but it's all I have going right now.

I signed the offer and was reviewing the employee handbook/policies when I found an addendum stating that hybrid work was only possible after 60 days FT in office. I expressed concern to the hiring manager as this had not been disclosed until now, and he responded that it was to ensure that I was able to get oriented and up to speed with the pace of the agency. However, I have three years of agency experience (and a total of 8 years in my field), and I've been working fully remote for even longer, which is to say that I have been onboarded remotely quite a few times at this point. It isn't difficult IMO.

I'm meant to start next Tuesday and I haven't responded to the email yet, since I'm not really sure what to say anymore. I'm thinking of suggesting three days on site with a concrete plan for days working offsite, and regrouping as needed when back onsite the following week, also leaning heavily on the fact that I've worked remotely with demonstrated success for a good length of time now.

I kind of want to back out - I have a pretty decent amount of contract work to keep me afloat and I'm pretty far along in the interview process for other positions (which may mean nothing after this week), so I'm thinking about continuing the search, which I honestly planned to do anyway after starting this position since it doesn't really align with what I'm looking for.

Am I wrong for thinking this is disingenuous? My spouse wonders what other tricks they may have!

I was earning $16.50 an hour as a Machine Operator. Basically, the lowest level of a machinest. Every 6 months was a review where, if the production staff performed well, we'd individually be given a merit raise. I did not receive my merit raise of 24¢. The Production Supervisor had it out for me from day one. But, I kept my head down, and I persevered.

Later, in the year 2021, there was a restructuring, and I was transferred to a different team in the same department. I was immediately recognized by my new Team Lead and Production Supervisor. By the next review date, I was promoted to a Technical Operator. Basically, it's a proven machinest. Someone who csn donthe work and do it well, even troubleshooting machinery. For this, I received a pay bump. I was now earning $18.78.

In early 2022, the employer gave a $2 raise across the board for COLA. I was now earning $20.78 an hour. Not a month later, I applied for an internal job posting. To my surprise, I was promoted to be a covetted Admin Support. I was informed that I'd earn $24.78, but last-minute, it was lowered to $22.28. I accepted anyway for the opportunity.

In the span of 1.5 years, I had increased my pay by $5.78. I was on cloud 9. I diligently did my work, fulfilling all expectations of my new role for a whole year. Then, before my one year review, I found out that compared to other Admin Support members, I was earning as much as $5 LESS than them. Admin Support members were being hired externally for $25 an hour.

In early March, during my year review, I broke down all of my KPI projects and how they've benefitted both the department and the company. All I wanted was a $1 raise. I wanted at minimum to earn $23.28. Instead, I was given 67¢ [proof]. I was told that if I wasn't happy, I could look elsewhere for employment.

So, I began quiet quitting. I did my role and fulfilled my responsibilities? But I stopped going above and beyond. This was immediately noticeable by my supervisor because the small team heavily relied on my busy bee work ethic. As the work was being diverted back to her (the supervisor) and my colleague (her best friend), this upset them.

Unbeknownst to me, she began the process of fabricating "behavior incidences" to have me terminated. However, because I was a high performer and I was known for getting work done, they couldn't terminate me. So, they demoted me based on these faulty behavior incidences.

To add insult to injury, not only was I sent back to production, they shipped me to a different department. On an offshift. AND, I had to take a 25¢ paycut. After two weeks in the demoted position, after traversing the Constructive Termination, I tossed in the towel and quit. I had nothing lined up. They had won. This was mid-May.

From mid-May to mid-June, I was applying and interviewing. I had lost hope. I submitted well lver 100 applications. Only a handful gave me the courtesy of a phone screening. Ultimately, I accepted another Machine Operator role somewhere else. It would only pay $18.00 to start.

Then, I received this offer [proof]. I went from wanting a $1 raise and being muscled out for having the gall to ask to now earning nearly DOUBLE my salary 🤣 I never thought I'd be here. The validation. The joy. I wouldn't have had this opportunity if my previous employer just gave me a $1 raise.

Hang in there. We're all in the struggle. Your time to shine is coming up. Persevere.

My team and I have been working remotely and it has been a huge success. Productivity is going great and we also get to have a decent work-life balance.

My boss lets us work remotely as much as we want, as long as we get our work done.

However, HR is pushing us to go back to the office and will make a “2-3 days a week in the office” policy.

I’m not against hybrid work, but I’m not looking forward to being forced into going to the office when I don’t need to. It’s a waste of time and money and it’s going to worsen my mental health.

Can someone tell me why we need to go back to a less efficient routine?

I accepted a job and it took almost 3 weeks for drug and background.

I was told last week by this third party company that hired for the position that I was starting today.

I still have not gotten an official letter stating my start date and time, location m, dress attire, and point of contact for the company.

I’m still sitting at home waiting.

Is this normal?

Edit: HR reached out. HR on PST. It appears there was a misunderstanding between the contracted company and my direct recruiter.

My position starts 4/24, not 4/17 as said to me on Friday the 14th.

Thank you everyone for your kind replies, except the asshole who said I was slow. You can f* off.

So I went through an interview process and a trial shift at a cafe/food location a few days ago. Everything was well and they filled my entire upcoming weeks with shifts. Today I showed up for my first and had an incredibly busy shift, with a fairly incompetent coworker who was coasting his way through work. Now as a barista Im capable of serving coffee which is of higher standard than most of the others working there, despite being out of work for a year and which they knew and still offered me the job. But when it comes to cold drinks which are store specific, I have no clue so Im asking and learning throughout the shift. 0 complaints or send backs through around 400 customers in 3 hours. As soon as the store quietens down Im called in by the manager and told I’m not ready to work here. Keep in mind that no training was provided prior to this shift, and I don’t mean coffee training, which I was capable of serving. What am I to make of this dismissal?

Update- my friend who has been working there for a month now did a bit of investigating with some of the supervisors. Apparently my co-worker reported me to management for appearing to be on cocaine🫡

I've had this experience recently MULTIPLE times. I would do an interview or multiple rounds of interviews with HR, hiring managers, team members, etc., and then radio silence afterwards for months.

I mean, I get that I haven't gotten the job obviously when I still haven't heard anything back 3-4 months later, but like come on guys isn't this just basic manners or etiquette to just let people know?

For one company I even did an on-site interview with like 10 people at once including VPs and all sorts of senior people and...fucking radio silence for MONTHS at this point.

If you are a hiring manager and reading this, like what the fuck man? What's going on?

I got a rejection email today from an application I put in over two weeks ago.

Here’s some background.

This position is the exact same one I’m doing now. Job descriptions identical. I had to do very little revision to my resume because they were THAT close.

This position is considered entry level at this place. Not where I am but whatever. They asked for minimum 3-5 years experience. I have 10. They asked for a BS in education. I have that. They wanted a masters in Curriculum and Instruction, Instructional Design, or Educational Leadership. I have the first one. Salary range commiserated with what I currently make.

The email states I was rejected for not having enough work experience and not having the correct educational level.

This tells me a few things:

They didn’t actually read my resume or application which, okay, fine, they probably had a ton, but maybe don’t have a generic email that faults lack of experience when that’s clearly not it.

This was probably posted for legal reasons and they hired someone internally.

I have a masters in the the listed education qualifications. Again, this is in my LinkedIn and my resume. My current job also requires this degree level and program to do the job through them. So to say I don’t have the correct educational level again tells me they didn’t look at it and the email is generic.

It really floors me that employers are complaining about applicants but have the gull to be so disorganized that they can’t even write a generic rejection email properly. And the email was sent by the hiring manager. It wasn’t even like an automatically generated one.

So I have a 2 weeks resignation notice in the contract, but I handed in a notice for 2 months.

The company immediately blocked my IT user account so I cannot access files, and then asked me to leave the same day. Before leaving, they asked that I change the notice to 2 weeks. Being naive as always, I complied but now realise that they did it to avoid paying me for the other month because they also didn't wanna fire me and then pay a severence pay.

Forget about the notice period if you plan to resign! Assume you'll get let go the same day, so get your benefits!
It's the HR and management's job to maximise the company's interest, and they will do this at your expense. Fair game, but I chose not to play.

My wife took our chihuahua to the be today after and emergency visit on Monday. She pee’d blood.

Well, my dogs is 16 with congestive heart failure and a possibly UTI.

Call my boss almost crying telling him I need to put the dog down. Recommend by the vet not to wait on it.

Eventually she’ll have a heart attack, or suffocate in her sleep due to the water/fluids collecting around the heart.

He replies with “I have three guys out already on Friday. Can’t you do it in your Saturday?”.

I obviously thought of that, but the only option for weekend veteran services is the pet ER. Which will obviously be more expensive.

My vet with cremate her, and out her in a urn for $500.

I’ve had this dog since I was a sophomore/junior in high school I’m in my 30s now.

I’m obviously missing work so I can spend the last day with my dog. I don’t want to put her down tomorrow/Thursday because I’m sure it’s going to affect me over the weekend. I also work 12-14 hour days; I want to play with her and feed her a steak bone. I want to sit with her when they put her to sleep.

Am I being “soft”, or am I justified on being a little irritated/angry by the comment?

My occupation doesn’t function well when guys miss work because all it does is create more work for myself, and possibly coworkers.

Why do US employees have such horrible sick leave and time off policies? Many times if you get sick you have to take time off without pay. If you’re lucky enough to have sick time, it’s usually a small handful of days.

I’m a designer at a small company with total of 5 people. I work 9-6, earning around 1800dollars. I don’t make alot. And we don’t get paid to work more. Normally I have worked late once every three months, and if busy 2 times a month.

Normally I go home exactly at 6. And I always finish the job on time.

But past 3 weeks, my boss is getting pissed when I leave work. When I say See u, she normally replies back. But these days she barely responds. Just a “mhm” in a really pissed off tone.

Last time at the meeting, she told us to re-do my work based of some references. She said if you think its not enough, you should stay late and work on it. I didn’t work late, but I finished it right on time and showed her today.

She told me I don’t put my best effort into my work these days. And she was quite mad at me for not thinking. So she told me to re-do it. I did it again, finished it and I was leaving work today. I told her see you. And She completely ignored me and walked passed me.

I’m very confused. She is mad at me for what? Fyi this is my first time working, its been 8-9 months.

So I got hired in a company after moving to a new city.

First few weeks were ok so far. Coworkers, despite their blunt way of communicating sometimes, are professional, "to the point" and do their job.

As this company is in semiconductors industry, frequent business trips to Asia are to be expected and are part of my job.

So a few days ago I came back from my first trip in Asia with some of my new coworkers, and I admit to be baffled by what happened here.

The first days of the trip was pretty usual: we dealt with the client, endless meetings and negotiations. Things then went well and objectives were pretty much met. So we decided to relax, go visit the city and eat at a restaurant. That's where things started to get weird: while we were drinking beer, my coworkers decided to hire local hookers for the night and blow some celebration.

I was quite surprised, cause they all are married with kids. But hey, its their private life, they do they and none of my business. I still felt it was gross, lame and cringey. But, again, as long as no one is hurt, they are free men.

However, they started to peer pressure me to go with them and participate in this prostitute party thing. Scrolling pictures of girls on hooker websites, showing them to me "Which one would be for you? This one! You think she'll be able to fit you in?" while laughing.

I mean, I am in a relationship too and they know it. I refused and frankly started to get pissed because they insisted, mocked me etc. Then, one of them a bit drunk angrily said that basically my attitude won't help me integrate the company and become part of the "pack" (ie the team).

I immediately left the bar and took leave for my hotel. Next day we took the plane back to home, I was alone, felt really ostracized, didn't talk to them during the fly while they were exchaning words and talked job things.

Supposed to go back to office this Monday, at one hand not so sure I want to go back there, on the other hand I blame myself for not handling the situation well and not having proper social skills to navigate through these tough situations. Maybe I should've bought a hooker without really consuming her? Just to bamboozle them into thinking I did as them?

About a week ago, my (terrible) boss called me into a meeting, where I got the news that they are cutting the budget for the department and I am one of the ‘lucky’ ones to be layed off.

I really hate this job, the company and my team are very toxic. I have been looking for another one over the past few months, and just yesterday I got a much better offer, which I am extremely happy about. On top of that, I’m getting severance (2 months salary), which makes me feel like even more of a winner. :D

But the best part… there is this really cringy, company-wide corporate retreat happening this week. You know, the kind where you’re expected to be “excited” and “proud” of the company, all kinds of idiotic corporate buzzwords are being shouted at you from every direction, useless executive coaching activities where everyone’s supposed to proclaim how “inspired” and “empowered” they feel… etc. Anyways, my boss told me that they still want me to work for 2 more weeks to tie up loose ends, BUT that I wouldn’t be allowed to attend the corporate retreat, expecting me to be sad about it (as it was being hyped up to all employees for the past 6 months).

So now, I’m just relaxing and basically doing nothing, since everyone else is at the retreat for most of this week. My last day is next Friday and this is something that I’m actually super excited about. :D

Edit: Guys, thank you for all of the support! This new job will be a bit of a career shift, where I’ll be doing something that’s more closely related to my university degree. Not gonna lie, I’m a quite nervous, but hopefully it’ll turn out alright. :)

It's so annoying.

Is there a silent rule to expressing that you're leaving a job/getting ready to leave?

My dad once told me that I shouldn't express I'm leaving until I actually put in my notice because you never know who is against you... But I never really thought of it in that way.

I had my final 1 hour interview at 10 am at the end they said I will know in a week. I took a nap because the anxiety I had afterwords. And at 4:30 pm the hr rep reached out to me and asked how the interview went. I thought it was a silly question to ask, then

I got offered the job today, that interviewer was impressed and really liked me.

. I am so happy it doesnt feel real yet.

I have “unlimited” PTO at my job. Three weeks ago I had an accident and have been off work since, with an expected return date one week from now. Even though we have “unlimited” PTO, since I was out more than five days on medical leave, I have to file paperwork to go on Short Term Disability resulting in my pay being reduced to 60% until I return. Be very suspicion of unlimited PTO and time taken, rules seem to be at the employers discretion.

So I (16f) have been working as a lifeguard for 2 years now at the company that recently terminated me. I’ve never particularly liked the management at this job but i kept working because of the pay. Anyways today I was working a 4-9 shift at a neighborhood pool and was feeling quite fatigued and dizzy (the temperature was in the high 90s and it was very sunny outside) Usually this kind of weather is uncomfortable for me but nothing i can’t handle, but for some reason today It really took a toll on me and by 7 i was feeling exhausted and about ready to fall over.

I told myself that i was going to have to call in to close early at 8 because i felt so bad (i have never once missed a shift or left early before today). 8 came around and i called the manager phone and explained how I felt too sick to be on stand and requested to close early. My manager then proceeded to insist that i stayed and said she had nobody to replace me with. We went back and forth for about ten minutes with her saying things like “i need you to just stick it out”. The conversation finally ended with me basically telling her that i couldn’t responsibly be on stand when i was feeling like this and that it was unethical of her to ask me to do so and that if this meant i would be fired then fine.

I then closed the pool and left at about 8:15, she later sent me a text saying if i didn’t provide a doctors note within 3 days i would be fired. Getting a doctors note isn’t a problem but the question i have is if it’s even worth staying at the company after this interaction. I don’t particularly need the money i was just working because i like to have some sort of income source during the summer but now that school has started it’s not necessary for me to have a part time job

Title.

I feel like applying on Linkedin and Indeed is meaningless. Everything is so automated now that I don't even think an actual human looks at the resumes anymore. They're just screened by some sort of dystopian HAL 9000 and discarded without any regard for the nuance of the qualifications/experience listed.

Ironically, I got my current job through Indeed...but that was almost 2 years ago, and recruiters seemed much more responsive back then. As of right now, I've applied to dozens and dozens of places and have received precisely 2 callbacks and 2 interviews. Both were ultimately rejections.

Does anybody have any tips for applying outside of online job boards? I don't really have a "network" per se and wouldn't know how to get a job through one if I did.

TIA for your answers/advice.

So, I’ve been job hunting for a few months now and I have had my fair share of unusual experiences. But yesterday took the cake.

I applied for a position at a unique local entertainment startup. They sent me an email to set up a time for an interview, but they wouldn’t disclose the location. They only mentioned it would be “somewhere inspiring.” I assumed maybe a trendy coffee shop or a creative co-working space.

The day of the interview arrived. I got a text with the location - it was a local amusement park. Confused, I called them to double-check, and they confirmed it wasn’t a mistake. So I showed up in my suit, holding my portfolio, looking completely out of place amidst families and kids in casual wear.

When I met the interviewer, he purchased two tickets for the Ferris wheel. To say I was bewildered would be an understatement. But he assured me it was all part of their “unique interview process”. We hopped into one of the cabins, and as soon as we were at the top of the Ferris wheel, the interview began.

Honestly, it was one of the most relaxed, engaging, and thoughtful interviews I’ve ever had. The interviewer explained that they believe in disrupting typical environments to foster creativity and unexpected conversations. We had some laughs, shared our views on work and life, and connected on a very human level.

I’m still waiting to hear back about the job, but this was an experience I wanted to share. It’s a reminder that interviews and workplaces can come in all sorts of unexpected formats, and to always be open to something a little different.

I work an office job as a Data Analyst for a small company, and I find that I rarely have anything meaningful to do. The jobs I do have are finished very quickly and afterwards I find myself back on my phone browsing endlessly. I fear for my job security as I feel expendable, though I don't think my bosses realise I have no work to do!

I'd much rather have work to do as it makes the day go faster. I really can't deal with having nothing to do! Is this a "normal" thing in an office working environment?

I'm talking like $16/h it's crazy

As the title says, anyone who has muttered this phrase is completely privileged and out of touch with reality.

No, I am not going to work at McDonald's making $16/h as a 35 year old. It's not that it's beneath me, its that I have a family to support, and IT IS NOT A LIVEABLE WAGE!!!!

You want to make things liveable again? Let's talk about getting institutional and foreign investments out of our real estate market. That would be a good start. For the love of God though, STOP reporting job growth on shit jobs that people can't afford to survive on.

Everyone is willing to work, but no one wants to live exist like a slave.

Edit: to people saying you shouldn't have kids or question why you'd have to work at McDonald's at 35, this is not my situation. I just have enough EMPATHY to understand that people are struggling, life happens, and there's not a lot out there right now. Your simpleminded "I'm good so other people suffering isn't an issue" thinking is basically the root of the problem.

My daughter (27 years old) turned in her two week notice at her full time job today. She’s been working part time at her childhood job since she was 15, has always loved that company, and they offered her a full time, permanent position in the office so she jumped on it. I’m so happy for her!

Anyway, her manager refused to accept her written two week notice after a scheduled meeting. My daughter then emailed her notice to her manager and director with her end date. No response from them. Around lunchtime someone from HR came up to her desk and said she had to leave immediately. I prepared her for the fact this might happen so she had removed all her personal items last week. While she was being escorted out her now former manager stopped her and asked for information on her workload, where she left off on things, etc. and tired to make her feel guilty for putting her former team in a bad spot. She didn’t say too much except thank you for the opportunity and left. She’s not too happy it happened this way but she has her eye on a much better future.

Just finished up drinks with my best friend. I will call her "Amy". She just made a big move back to our home state from 6 hours away, and no longer has a job after todays events. Where apparently, her new department meant to hire an entirely different person and HR went ahead and hired her.

Amy sold her condo and closed on a house here. She was so excited about this new job. Big opportunity, almost double her pay as she left 12 yrs in the no profit sector for the private sector. Started her on boarding with HR, ID photos, W2, and all that paperwork on Friday. Monday was all the HR and compliance videos. Tuesday AM was IT stuff, got assigned her credentials and laptop, and walked through all their company programs she would be using. After lunch, the HR rep walks her to her new department, where she is reintroduced to her department head and immediate supervisor. I say reintroduced because she told me HR rep, Department Head, and Supervisor were all part of her final interview. Here is where it all goes wrong.

Department head shakes her hand and says: "Lucy, we are so glad to welcome you. Hope everything went well with the move."

Amy: "The move went well, and it's nice to be back home closer to my family. But, it's actually Amy."

Department Head: looks at her paperwork "It's not Lucy Stillwater?"

Amy: shakes her head no. "Nope, my name is Amy."

Department head: looks at the HR Rep. "I must have been given the wrong paperwork. Give me a moment while we get this fixed up."

The supervisor starts to give her a tour of the physical department, while HR and Department Head step away. 15 minutes later after a tour and being introduced to her new coworkers, and being shown "her" office that has the name "Lucy Stillwater" next to the door HR comes back and hands her a letter and tells her "unfortunately, we will be unable to offer you this position at this time. Please hand me your employee badge and laptop. You will be mailed a check for your time you have spent training here and moving cost reimbursement as discussed. Michael here will make sure you get safe to your car and will swipe you out of the garage so you are not charged"

I left work early and have been drinking with here since then, listening to this story in horror. She just cried herself to sleep on her couch in a house she may have to sell because she is now unemployed. What the hell is wrong with this world.

UPDATE: Amy has a consult with an employment attorney who is a friend of her father's this afternoon. And two more attorney consults tomorrow and should have a better picture of the situation then. I will try to update this post whenever new info is conveyed to me. Have forwarded all advice that seemed relevant.

A month ago we had an all hands meeting where our CEO said "we will not be doing layoffs" when asked. Today I was laid off.

I woke up at 6:30 AM and saw an email saying I had an "urgent meeting" at 8:30. I laid in bed for the next hour full of anxiety and texting my coworkers. One of them tells me how our entire APAC office was let go. Another starts telling me about specific supervisors who have been let go.

So 8 am I clock on and try to work for 30 mins but I can't work. I can't focus. I am just crying knowing what's going to happen.

I join the meeting at 8:30 and am hit with "we are here to share some devastating news....". Apparently my position is being outsourced to Mexico (I'm in US) and I'm being let go.

I get 6 weeks of severance. I have been looking for jobs for 6 months with no luck. I don't know how I'm supposed to find something in 6 weeks. I feel like I've been punched in the gut.

I've been with this company for 4 years. I don't know what to do or how to feel. I've never been let go before

EDITED to ask: does anyone know if I can apply for unemployment now or do I need to wait for my severance to end? I'm on Alaska of it matters. I'm too emotional to call the unemployment office right now

SECOND EDIT: I am overwhelmed with all the love and support. I've gotten some great advice. Thank you so much. 💓

So about 60 of us were laid off I'm totally. Seems there might be more when the UK office clocks in tonight, but im sure my coworkers will update me.

I've had multiple managers at my job tell me something along the lines of not wanting to be blindsided by me going to work somewhere else. The language is always something about wanting there to be open and honest communication about whether or not I'm happy in my role, etc. Is this weird? I work at a church, so the culture is a bit different than most workplaces. I do trust the people I work with, but it also feels very risky to ever disclose to an employer that you're looking for a new job, with no idea if you'll actually find a new job soon (the situation I'm currently in).

Every day in this subreddit there's someone saying they can't find a job, and when asked, turns out they only started applying after graduation. Sometimes months after.

The timeline of events should be as follows:

July (before your final year) - Begin researching your future and what roles would suit you and what you want to do

August - Prepare your CV, have a list fo companies you want to apply to

September -> January - Applications open - start applying. It's a numbers game so apply to as many as possible to get have the best chance of success

February - Most deadlines have passed, graduate schemes will now filter through the applicants and choose their favourites

March -> August - Tests, assessmnet centres, interviews

September - If successful, you will begin your graduate scheme. If not, begin applications again.

The playing field is super competitive so it's important to prepare and manage your time accordingly so you can apply months before you graduate. Thoughts on the above timeline?

EDIT:

For people asking for more information about the above timeline see https://www.graduatejobsuk.co.uk/post/when-is-it-too-late-to-apply-for-graduate-jobs.

I was hired as an assistant manager at a very popular retail store back in 2022. I eventually found out I was just their diversity hire as it slipped they needed to hit numbers for more POC on the sales floor. I also realized no one took me seriously, was always talked over, disregarded and talked down to, and my manager responsibilities were given to other managers while I was used as a fill in 80% of the time.

Things turned sour as soon as I hit my 6 month mark and suddenly I had numerous complaints about me. Was told to go home and I was on a paid hold until I heard something from HR. Well, I was ghosted for a month by HR and my managers until I called corporate.

I obviously did not want to go back to work for the company after all this. I gave HR my two week notice and got the rest of my pay check. I spoke to a family member about the situation, who had worked in HR for 6+ years, she said it very much sounded like we all were diversity hired and obviously weren't meant to stay long.

She gave me the advice to tell interviewers that it was a temp/seasonal position for the summer. Also to say I couldn't list references as I worked with minors or very young adults. However, if they really did push to low key have a friend (who knew retail) pretend and vouch for me, if I really needed it.

Is this sound advice or should I be honest about being a fill in for a job?

Edit1: Thank you all for the comments! I do appreciate it! To clear some things up, I did take initiative in the role. I did ask the other managers and SM for help on how the store was normally ran but I kept getting different answers. Everyone had their way of doing things and it wasn't consistent. SM did not like that I tried to impliment different things to learn. She had a very OCD way of doing things but it cut into my time of running the sales floor. She'd want me to write down our KPIs in a binder with pen and paper instead of using our computer system for accuracy. The first 2 months I did ask how my performance was doing and was told I was doing fine and that I was making sales. After that, my performance was never broached or I was told I was doing good and not to worry. So I didn't think much of it. I never was properly trained and a lot of the other managers got away with things because they had known the manager since they worked in the store as teens years ago. Also, this was not a salaried position but hourly. I've been an ASM in the past and had done fine with no issues. What I felt confused about was that I would direct my sales team and then hear my manager on our ear piece saying to disregard my guidance and do it her way when I was the MOD for the hour. I'd talked to her about it but she wouldn't take accountibility for the back and forth. She had a habit of expecting people to read in between the lines when I'd ask her to just be direct. She also would hire POC and disregard their unavailable days and schedule them regardless. This led to some of the teens having no shows due to them trusting her when she'd promise their days off.

An example of how I lost some respect with my sales team: A WOC had asked me if she had enough time to put in a 4 day leave as she was going to some college open house with her family. I told her yes, that she had two weeks in advance and it should be fine and that I'd text and leave a note for the SM to make sure she saw the time off sheet. SM saw it, I mentioned it, told me she took care of it and still scheduled that employee and gave her a warning for missing her shifts. I did not know that until the week of and told SM she had made a mistake. She said "Oops. Oh well. Guess I'll have to talk to her for missing then." Employee obviously was upset as I told her I'd be diligent in letting SM know. I was. Unfortunately the incident spread through the store and I was avoided for the most part.

Edit 2: I know future employers are only supposed to get clarification on when I worked, job title and to make sure I was actually at the job. But I have heard a lot of previous and current managers tell people that they wouldn't hire XYZ again and leave it at that.

Edit 3: I'm seeing some comments about my qualifications about being in the ASM role. This was not my first job or even a second. I'd worked 3 retail jobs consistently between 2013 to end of 2015. Each role I went up from being sales floor, customer service agent to even ASM at another retailer before the store closed. During 2015-2019 I was married to a military personal and we moved frequently along with living overseas. In 2020 I worked during covid and had successfully kept a year long job until I needed to find a higher paying job. Between then I had a 6 month contract job then the 6 month stint as the ASM at the retail store in question.

Some of these comments are borderline racist in themselves. Btw, I'm not black. I'm Asian, a woman, and not some newbie in my early 20s.

To clarify, I work in the Midwest, USA.

I interviewed for a "coordinator" role in a company in a major city yesterday that was very generic about data stewardship. I've done this in a similar company before - I'll admit, it's mostly data entry, electronic record keeping, research, administrative work within existing records, using ERP correctly. Stuff I have experience in.

...Every interview, including this one, has become a horrible game of trick questions where the interviewer conceals the actual skill level required. Nothing about training. Extraordinary discrepancies between job description and specific requirements, like expert level Excel.

Sometimes they overshoot what is actually required. They go out of their way not only to give the impression there will be no training within the job to do the job, use the software, do the tasks they need a qualified candidate to do - I realized in this case the interviewer had lied about the actual responsibilities of the job.

He started asking me what I know about VBA, querying large data sets in Excel (if you guys have notes, I would be grateful - I've never done Power Query before, only basic functions, up to something like offset/match, tables.)

It's very hard to get that training, it seems, unless your fresh out of college - after internships. I only have a little as a contractor, and I was on my own, mostly, using what I've picked up in Excel workshops.

When I pointed out it seems they're look for a sales analyst, the interviewer argued with me and said it was a different job.

This is the second time this has happened, the second job, where I apply to my former job title...and find I have to talk about writing fucking Excel macros. Have to desperately, flabbergastedly talk about tutorials I've taken on querying large data sets with SQL.

This is for a job in a major American city that requires at least 3 days onsite and starts at $43k. It's not even the decline in pay...its the skills expectation for that salary and the horrible experience of being made to feel like I did something wrong when I just applied to an "entry level" opening that seemed to match my background.

No reporters are talking about this trend (not just my job search-shouldn't have to clarify that), but I don't think it's just me....it seems like there's a requirements/pay mismatch across more than a few white collar industries that got worse sometime in 2023, and I don't think I would believe this if I weren't going through it. NYT did a couple of articles on the Great Resignation....this seems comparable or like a reversal.

It's been a year of searching in a market that's gotten worse....last year was bad, this year is like a Twilight Zone nightmare of people asking for senior sales analysts under "administrative assistant" jobs.

And that doesn't cover the jobs in tech where my interviews are 25 year old managers with theater/fashion degrees somehow working as financial managers who just...don't want to work with someone older than they are.

Every five years the job market gets worse and worse, and the skills requirements skyrocket.

That's a frightening prospect if you are in your 20s and coming into the job market for the first time, but if you are lifelong underemployed, like me, and have a shitty resume (a few years of experience, but all for contract projects, or in dead end office jobs in horrible companies)...I'm at my wit's end. The stigma never really goes away barring something extraordinary, like a Master's degree...and even then, it's hopeless unless someone just...gives you a chance.

Note, the only reason I applied to this job was because the job description actually seemed to match my background, or general enough I could have hope. Hiring for my previous job title and its actual duties has disappeared.

I'm seeing jobs for sales analysts that want Salesforce certifications, 3 years of managing a companies' "business processes", Masters' etc. that start at $60k and tap out at $75k.

Its really fucking bad out there, and not only am I afraid seeing salaries shrink while skill requirements for "entry level" jobs explode...I've never actually been trained in a single job I've ever done. Not really. Not to stay in a job, only as a contractor, and of course, that's short-lived and can't truly be practiced and built upon within that role.

I've never enjoyed the normal experience of being taken on, trained, kept, and promoted because I didn't intern and came into the job market after I wasted a lot of time in grad school. It wasn't for lack of desire or work in those jobs.

...And thus, even if I can work towards certifications, take Coursera courses, take tutorials by myself...none of really matters. It's all done alone, and it's not "demonstrable experience". It's unpaid labor with precious little direction to get to the first interview stage with people who treat my resume like a wad of used toilet paper anyway.

So much of what I'm seeing in job listings now points to a level of training you can't even do on your own without paying for a software license. Over and over.

Is anyone else experiencing this or seeing this?

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the input. I was already on the fence about this switch, and you all added the extra nudge I needed. I decided to decline the offer. What actually ended up being the deciding factor for me was commuting. I kept trying to convince myself it wouldn't be that bad, but I knew it would eat into my time and sanity. I really appreciate the advice I got here, and I hope you all have a laid-back start to the week with a casual dog walk thrown in there... I know I will ��

I currently work in the environmental monitoring sector of my state government. My job has busy times, but it's generally pretty easy. I work from home and have a ton of flexibility and time to do things I want to do. Many days, I am able to complete my work in a few hours and spend the rest of the time doing what I want. Currently, I receive a salary of $74,000 with no overtime (OT) and no bonus.

Recently, I received a job offer at a private company offering around $100,000 a year, 1.5X OT, and an $8,000 yearly bonus (merit-based). While the benefits aren't as good as my government job, they are still very good. This job will be stressful and require much more of my time. Although it's listed as a hybrid position, upper management made it sound like working from home was frowned upon. The office is a 30min commute away.

All that said, this job would be a good opportunity for me to expand my skill set. Also, working in the private sector offers a lot of upward mobility, whereas my current position has a glass ceiling that I am quickly approaching.

I personally enjoy my current job a lot of the time. I am doing meaningful work with a great group of people. However, it does feel a little "slow" at times, and I would, of course, enjoy being paid more. Any advice would be

TLDR: Is a $25,000 raise worth leaving a laid-back government job?

Long story short: I got a new job. Received little to no training (ended up defaulting to training myself on their new system that they aren’t understanding and using incorrectly), extremely high expectations with short deadlines, workload couldn’t be done within 70 hours a week due to having to train myself on top of more and more workload being put on me. When I asked questions- I was told to look up videos and figure it out. Got fired a couple months in. When I was asked what I spent most of my time on- I explained the above and listed the main issues the company as a whole was having and the work I did to find solutions (some of which were not in areas I work within) and showed it to them…the firing was retracted during the same meeting. Soooo…I still have a job, but is it a terrible idea to stay?

*Edit: Thank you all for the thoughts, insight and experiences you shared/are sharing. I truly appreciate it ❤️

*Edit: just want to clarify that I have not solved all their problems by a long shot and am still very lost in their system, but was taking time to search out solutions to fixing the glaring issues and get those resources to the correct person using that area. Was fired because I wasn’t able to hit the marks/tasks/goals given to me on what I was hired to do. Just want to be honest- I’m not a wizard. 😉

Accepted an offer for 103k and started on Monday. This company was honestly my second choice and today my 1st choice called me and offered me a position. Money is about the same but the 1st choice offers remote work 2x a week and better benefits/pension. The new job won't start for 30 days and since I'm new and providing no benefit to the company I know if I give my notice they will likely just have me leave that day. I want to keep collecting a paycheck and will probably just ride out the next month doing my onboarding stuff and then just peace out.

I know this is probably scummy but companies rarely care about the individual so why should I care about them

A few months ago my job decided that they didn’t want to pay me the amount that they were paying me. So they decided to just let me go. And I was with the company for a long time. I trained half the staff. Worked holidays, and changed my schedule when asked. My job accused me of doing something that I didn’t do, as the excuse to fire me. The reason why I know they fired me because they didn’t want to pay me, was because two weeks before they gave me a good employee review and raised my pay. What pisses me off is they could’ve told me that they couldn’t pay me and that they had to cut my hours or pay. Why let me go? There’s nothing that I could legally do because my company is at will. Now I am struggling to find a job, and my unemployment insurance runs out in three months. Idk what to do.

Just got word that a job opportunity that I really thought I had in the bag just decided to take a pass on me and go forward with other people. I’ve been through multiple interviews with them and felt like I did well on all of them only to find out they didn’t want me anyway. Right now my morale is going down, and this terrible job market isn’t helping. Feels like I’ve sent out hundreds of applications, and only a few of them decided to get back to me. Doesn’t help that my current industry’s job market is even worse. Is it just me, or does it feel like employers are allowed to be REALLY picky with who they hire? I get that there’s a lot of people looking for work and not enough positions, but damn. Feels like I can’t even get a job doing the most basic stuff for minimum wage nowadays.

My job had 401k listed in the ad.... I also asked about these benefits during the first interview and was told that they had a 401k. Then after I was onboarded and started working I found out that there was no 401k, but they felt it was ok to say that they had one because they were PLANNING ON GETTING ONE by earlier next year.

So naturally I'm now looking for another job. Got asked to interview for an ad where it was said that the job was remote, but might move to a 1 day/week hybrid role. Great sounds perfect. In the first, 2nd AND 3rd interviews I made sure to confirm this and it was confirmed each time.

But now in the 4th and final interview I'm suddenly told that actually they're really hoping for a person will be fully in office 5 days a week! All this time wasted!

I'm so fucking sick of this. Even if I accept this position, I will once again be using all of my lunch hours trying to find yet ANOTHER job thanks to being lied to again.!

Employers are flat out lying in order to get candidates that they know would otherwise never apply. Fuck them. If I accept this job I'll do the same damn thing I'm planning to do with the one I have now- Use all my lunch breaks to interview and apply elsewhere and give them ZERO notice when I leave.

I have been actively looking for jobs, as my mental health has gotten bad here. I work well over 40/hrs a week making only about 1200 biweekly. Today i was told I can quit for $2000. I’d love too but I don’t have anything lined up yet for future employment. I’d like somebody’s 10 cents.

EDIT: I have by the end of day today to decide.

EDIT 2: I’m staying. Thank you all.

I work at a car wash, been there for about a month. I started out at $11 an hour & now I’m going to be bumped up to $14 an hour & I will be main a key holder/supervisor & im super excited! I’ll mainly be closing the Carwash down but I’m super super excited. I’ve been busting my ass & my manager has noticed! Two people quit in the last week so today (June 9th) & tomorrow I’ll be picking up hours, pay is bi weekly & with both weeks I’ll be up to almost 73 hours!!!

Just a funny observation

My family and I go to Nags head, the 2nd week of august every year. This year is significant because my extended family is coming, and we’re spreading my uncles ashes. I’ve never had a problem with a job telling me no.

I started my job a few months ago, and told them about my vacation before they hired me. I reminded both my supervisor and the guy who does she scheduling, multiple times. I mean once a week for a few weeks.

We got our schedules on Sunday, and they scheduled me that week. We work 12 hour shifts. They usually schedule us 3 12s in a row…for that week, they scheduled me, Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. They NEVER do that.

So I bring this up with my boss. I reminded him, that he said it would be no problem when hiring me, and the subsequent weeks after.

He said “Well, you’re already on the schedule. There’s nothing I can do”

So now I’m screwed. If you switch a shift with someone, you have to make it up that same week. So I can’t switch a shift with someone, and make it up the following week

I’m so angry. I’ve had my deposit down on the house for almost a year. I’ve had my plane ticket for months

I started a job at the beginning of the month.

don’t get me wrong, the job itself isn’t bad, my coworkers are pretty cool, and the pay is fair enough, once I actually fucking get it.

They have “offset” pay periods here, so you get paid for two weeks of work, two weeks later. Once you’re going it’s fine, you’re paid every two weeks. But when you initially start you wind up having to wait a full month to get your first check.

I get it, pay schedules and all that.

But dude, I‘m starting to get really fucking annoyed that I’ve been here three weeks, I’ve been doing a good job, Ive burned my gas and time getting here the last three weeks, but I’m still fucking broke and I have another week to go before I get fucking paid.

mostly boomers. i don’t blame them because it’s baffling to me as well but they’ll be like “have you tried googling jobs for fresh graduates?” which i have ofc but they’ll also be like “have you tried calling the boss of whatever company and putting your best foot forward?” which is insane to me

anyway i just wanted to vent. i try explaining the flooded entry level candidate pool and how every “”entry level”” position in my field wants 3 to 5 years but they don’t seem to understand kek. it’s like their minds can’t comprehend it or something

Well I just got, yet another, rejection email. I've been looking for work for about 8 months now, ever since my dream job was taken from me. 90% of the time companies don't respond to my applications at all. I've had a few interviews and never hear from the company again. When I do get a follow up email, it's always a rejection. I've been looking on Indeed for entry level jobs but most of the time the requirements are "You need to be a doctor" "You need to be a registered nurse" "You need to be 20 years old with 40 years of experience" "You need to be able to lift 100 lbs and use a forklift at the same time". I'm almost ready to give up. This is so frustrating and discouraging to get nothing but rejection emails. I live with my disabled, Autistic boyfriend and his elderly mother. I'm the only one in my family capable of holding a job. We have absolutely no savings, have an outrageous amount of debt and have been severely struggling financially ever since I lost my job. I just feel like a huge failure.

I haven't worked in over a decade because of my bipolar disorder. I am finally going back to work because I am stable and have been for a while. I AM TERRIFIED.

The work is of my interest, the hours are to my liking, the pay is more than decent, and even one of my friends works in the office. I am still so, so scared.

I have my outfit picked out, and I packed my bag. Dyed my roots and did my nails. I am going to try to eat some dinner now.

I've wanted to return to the world of work for so long, and here I am. I would be thrilled if I wasn't so scared.

Hi all! I (26F) recently accepted a remote job after two rounds of interviews. The job seems to be with a legitimate company and the owners I met over zoom match up to the website but after accepting the job I was never sent anything to sign. They haven’t done any background checks or even asked for my full name or date of birth. It is a small business so maybe that’s not odd and it just slipped their minds? The part that made me a bit uneasy is that during the interview process the owners stated the position would be fully remote and there was no mention of travel even for training. Now that I’m “hired”(in quotes because there’s no proof and I haven’t signed anything) they’ve asked me to travel about an hour and a half to one of the owners homes for training. I thought this was odd because although the company operates remotely I’d think they’d at least want to meet somewhere public because we’re all essentially strangers at this point. I was trying not to overthink it but after telling some family members about this (who owned their own business in the past) they expressed that this isn’t normal and I need to be careful walking into someone’s home who I don’t know. I tried to communicate my apprehension with the owner and they stressed that going to their house was extremely important in the training process. Can anyone offer any insight? Am I thinking too much into this? Thanks in advance!

Editing for more context so no one thinks I’m a clueless moron- this job is in a very niche industry that I’m extremely qualified in. I did criminal searches for the names of the owners through the state they reside in and searched for home addresses to no avail. I thought this was strange also and wanted to confirm my suspicions.

EDIT AGAIN SO EVERYONE WILL STOP INSULTING MY INTELLIGENCE- I AM NOT GOING! I POSTED THIS TO CONFIRM MY SUSPICIONS THAT THIS ISN’T NORMAL AND WILL BE SAYING NO AND EXPRESSING THAT THIS SITUATION HAS MADE ME FEEL EXTREMELY UNEASY. THANK YOU FOR EVERYONES INPUT.

ETA: I did end up taking the job but I'm still going to look for something better. I was mostly trying to put my thoughts in writing and see if anyone had advice or thoughts, not really asking a question. I've got some rude messages about being an idiot if I passed up the opportunity.

I was laid off from my job 3 months ago along with around 30 other people from my large department. They stated it was due to the economy and nothing to do with my performance. This is a VERY large corporation and they had a company wide layoff that affected almost all departments.

Ive had several interviews for other jobs in my field that went well but no offers as of yet. They also haven't told me no.

Yesterday, I got a call from the Dept head of my old company (ironically same person who hired me and laid me off) asking if I would be interested in coming back. This was honestly the last thing I expected.

I mentioned pay would be a big factor and they said they would be open to better compensation.

I would be getting my vacation days returned and potentially more pay. I really liked the job, it was remote and flexible plus I don't have any other offers from other companies at this time.

They would also benefit from not having to train a new employee. Should I go back until I find something better or decline? It would bring money while I have no income so Im leaning towards accepting.

6 months ago I ended my internship at the United Nations in NYC. Then I decided to take some time off everything as being in NYC, while great, had been exhausting. I came back to Europe and spent the Christmas holidays just chilling at home.

Then on January the 9th I started looking for a job. Initially I was super relaxed because I thought, hey, I got two Msc and a UN internship - I will find a job right?

Wrong. It's been 5 months of complete utter silence. Nobody and I mean NOBODY ever replies. I don't even get shortlisted despite great references and a good CV template.

I slowly but surely fell into depression. I lost weight and now look gaunt and tired. I look dead and I feel dead. I feel like my brain would have so much potential and I'd want to do so many things but nobody allows me to. I have no money and if it weren't for my parents I'd have to use food stamps to eat.

And nothing will change for at least a month or two since I have currently no realistically viable applications (last rejection yesterday).

Unemployment is so horrible.

Please enlighten me. I have a stupid ass AP data entry job and the shit is made so much harder by dumbass politics and asskissers walking by my desk all day. And somehow still people smile all day like they’re not insane. WFH is it literally cruisable til Friday no stress at all. Are people just stupid?

My current job is phenomenal. I love the people. It is pretty stress free. And they have been very good to me. The only drawback is the pay. A few weeks ago they let me attend a conference that I asked to attend and paid for everything.

While at the conference, I was approached by a friend from a different company who told me that he wanted to connect me with someone who had some questions on the work that I had done at my current job. I interpreted this as him wanting to ask questions about specific projects I have worked on for advice as that is very common in my field.

In reality, he was interested in hiring me for a new branch of a pretty well established consulting firm as a project manager. I haven't been looking for a job but this one is pretty hard to ignore. It would result in a substantial raise as well as allow me to work from home, which is something I have been very interested in.

He said he would call me in a few days and send me the job description by email.

While interested I have no idea how to approach this with my current job. I feel like it would probably rub them the wrong way if they found out they paid me to go to a conference to get poached. It would also be a VERY bad time for me to leave. We have a two person department and one of them is new and we are in the middle of a few large projects that I'm pretty instrumental for. I would feel horrible doing that not only to my staff but also my boss as well. Like I said, this place has been great to me so I just want to do right by them. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I've heard this so much over the past few years and it's never not frustrating to hear it. "People just don't want to work anymore".

Yeah not many people do want to work your shitty fast food job or warehouse job you're hiring for where they get paid like shit, work shit hours and get shit benefits if any.

This is why these places are ALWAYS hiring because the turn around is horrendous. No one wants to work there. Meanwhile, I applied for an executive assistant role a few weeks ago and they hired and took down the job posting for it WITHIN the week. People want to work. But they want to work "good jobs" that can become careers and not horrible jobs.

I've been looking for a better job since the start of this year on places like indeed and zip recruiter, specifically for remote jobs that involve writing or marketing (I'm an English major with a few years of freelance content writer experience). Every time I apply to a half decent posting though, the applicant numbers are through the fucking roof! Hundreds of not thousands of applicants per job posting. Following up is damn near impossible (not that companies even seem to put in the effort to respond anyways). How the hell am I supposed to get a job doing this? I have next to no chance with every attempt despite being perfectly qualified. Like am I being crazy or has anyone else experienced this?

Nepotism - the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives, friends, or associates, especially by giving them jobs.

People always talk about how you need to network to get jobs, but scoff at the idea of folks getting hired above by being someone’s bff. I don’t think there’s a difference between networking and nepotism. It’s the same thing just one has a bad name than the other. I fucking hate the advice that you need to Network or use nepotism to get jobs. Regardless of how true this is, I feel like this is not talked about. Networking is nepotism in disguise.

In their email, they write "we've chosen candidates who closely match the requirements" like fool I had the exact job title and tick all of the experiences you're looking for as I've done this job before.

On month 3 of unemployment and I've already lost my mind, I feel so disheartened about this entire situation.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments, it's lovely to see a lot of support especially when I'm putting myself down.

So long story short, my son recently got diagnosed with autism and he’s very low functioning, the flip side of that is that my wife now has to quit her job, so we’ll be going from two salaries to one. In order to fill that void, I’ve been applying for some jobs which have the sort of required increase I need to cover the losses of my wife’s income.

I was worried that potential employers would see it as a red flag if I was looking for a major jump in salary, so I lied about how much I currently earn. I lied to my he recruiter and then carried that on at first and second interview with the hiring manager. Interviews went really well and they’ve asked for references, now I’ve shared those, the hiring manager let slip that he knows my current boss as they used to work together back in the day. I’m now worried my real salary will come out and effect my chances of receiving an offer for the new one.

Am I right to be worried? Should I come clean now?

Edit: Currently package is worth around £60k, I told them I was on £70k and I’m asking for £80k

My premature son was recently hospitalized due to a severe RSV infection. During his stay he must've passed it along to me and my wife because we both contracted it too. During all of this commotion, I put in for sick days Mon-Wed. Wed afternoon is when things with him got much worse. In the confusion and fear, I am 100% guilty of not remembering to add an addition 2 days of PTO (Thur and Fri) Boss said it was fraud and stealing from the company. I have lost my insurance, my pride, etc. I'm so worried this will stick with me forever.

See previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/102hueb/boss_has_decided_that_i_need_to_travel_to_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Firstly, thank you Reddit for giving me the courage to speak up. The comment that really hit me was that I should follow my intuition on this.

Secondly, I appreciate Redditors pointing out laws that my company would be breaking but I am UK based, not USA.

It was a very tense meeting with my manager and I still don’t think they fully understand my reasoning for why I didn’t want to commute 4/5 hours even though it is only once a week.

Their counter argument was that ‘travelling comes with the territory of the job’. I explained i would travel as per needs of the business but this new request was unreasonable.

Nail in the coffin was when I would go into the office as they requested but on company time and not mine.

In the end it was agreed that I would travel to the office once a week for January only but they would put me in a hotel.

From February onwards I only need to go once a month which again I have no qualms with.

I will not be budging on the above and I will die on this hill if I must. The request was bonkers.

There are people out there reporting that they had 4 or 5 or even 6 interviews and evaluation rounds before landing the job. In that case they came across a sub standard HR Manager/Recruiter/Boss.

Because a little more than half of all HR Managers/Recruiters/Bosses know if they want to hire someone within the first 5 Minutes of the first interview.

For most positions a 30-40 Minute interview is enough to find out if the the potential new employee has the skill and personality to fit in.

Two interviews are perfectly sufficent for 95%+ of all jobs - even if you have multiple candidates. Three are already overkill - I would say these are only resonable for the highest positions with a lot of responsibility and skill required.

But if they still cant tell you if they want to hire you after the 3d or even 4th interview - then the people doing the hiring process/interviews are just bad and incompetent.

I've been looking at jobs in other industries out of curiosity and I've noticed they don't match the cost of living. I've seen so many positions that require a bachelor's degree with 2-5 years of related experience and pay $15 hr . It's ridiculous. How do you expect your employees to survive? And the ones with a decent wage require years of experience. How are people surviving these days is what I wonder.

Came in to work and immediately got a teams call, knew immediately as HR was on the call. I’m taking myself out to breakfast cuz I just don’t know what else to do with myself.

Any advice? It took a really long time to find this job, I had severe interview anxiety for years. To the point where I mostly just did Uber and Lyft in lieu of a standard job. This was my first traditional job. I’m 36. Prior to that I was a perpetual duck up and also was I full time care giver for my mom.

I have a degree in English and the job I just left was for a huge education company just in web support, think very simple like password resets. Helping people Navigate software.

No idea what to do now. I get to put in a check through August 1. So I get paid like normal and am not expected to come in. Then I get 3 weeks for every year of service so an additional 3 weeks. I have a bunch of unused pto and vacation and I forgot to ask if that gets paid out

Edit: Thankyou so much everyone, I feel soooo much better! There’s so much great advice In here. Im still reading through all the responses so bear 🐻 with me.

And if you’re in the same situation, we can do this!!!

Every pre-interview phone screening/vetting conversion with HR people always seems like ot went well. The HR people are all the same "That's a great answer" "I can definitely understand" "I think you would be a great addition" blah blah. Then within a few days you get the email that they went with someone else, or get ghosted completely.

I swear every interview I have always feels like ot went awesome from the responses/feedback I receive, but starting to realize it's just HR phonies.

I work as a consultant, specializing in network security, and join my analytics teams when needed. Recently, we have started exploring AI, but it has been more of a “buzzword” than anything else; essentially, we are bundling and rephrasing Python-esque solutions with Microsoft retraining.

This is not what’s replacing jobs. What’s replacing jobs is the outsourcing to countries like India. Companies all over the United States are cutting positions domestically and replacing those workers with positions in India, ranging from managerial to mid-level and entry-level positions.

I’ll provide an insight into the salary differences. For instance, a Senior Data Scientist in the US, on average, earns $110,000-160,000 per year depending on experience, company, and location.

In India, a Senior Data Scientist earns ₹15,00,000-20,00,000, which converts to roughly $19,000-24,000 per year depending on experience, company, and location.

There is a high turnover rate with positions in India, despite the large workforce. However, there’s little to no collaboration with US teams.

Say what you will, but “the pending recession” is not an excuse for corporations to act this way. Also, this is merely my personal opinion, but it’s highly unlikely that we’ll face a recession of any sort.

Update: Thank you all for so many insightful comments. It seems that many of you have been impacted by outsourcing, which includes high-talent jobs.

In combination with outsourcing, which is not a new trend, the introduction of RPA and AI has caused a sort of shift in traditional business operations. Though there is no clear AI solution at the moment and it is merely a buzzword, I believe the plan is already in place. Hence, the current job market many of you are experiencing.

As AI continues to mature and is rolled out, it will reduce the number of jobs available both in the US and in outsourcing countries; more so in the actual outsourcing countries as the reduction has already happened in the US (assumption). It seems that we are in phase one: implement the teams offshore, phase two will be to automate their processes, phase three will be to cut costs by reducing offshore teams.

Despite record profits and revenue growth by many corporations over the last 5-10 years, corporations want to “cut costs.” To me, this is redundant and unnecessary.

I never thought I’d say this, but we need to get out there and influence policymakers. Really make it your agenda to push for politicians who will fight against AI in the workplace and outsourcing. Corporations are doing this because they can. To this point, please do not attempt to push any sort of political propaganda. This is not a political post. I’ve had to actually waste my own time researching a claim made by a commenter about what one president did and another supposedly undid. If you choose to, you can find the comment below. Lastly, neither party is doing anything. Corporations seem to be implementing this fast and furiously.

Please be mindful of the working conditions in the outsourcing countries. Oftentimes, they’re underpaid, there is much churn, male-dominated hierarchical work cultures and societies, long and overnight work hours. These are boardrooms and executives making decisions and pushing agendas. We’re all numbers on a spreadsheet.

If you’re currently feeling overwhelmed or in a position where you’ve lost your job, don’t give up. You truly are valuable. Please talk to someone or call/text 988.

Today I interviewed for a company, and was told their PTO is 15 days. I’m disappointed, but not surprised. My bf even said 15-20 is typical. I know the US completely sucks when it comes to PTO, sick days, maternity leave, etc.

I’m a server and am trying to get out of the service/food industry. I guess in my job, I have the luxury of being able to request any days off whenever. So going from that to only 15 feels like I’m being robbed of living my life.

How do you live life like this?? What if you need to go to the doctor/therapist?? They’re not open on weekends, and I def don’t wanna use my vacation days at the doctor…

I do want to grow my career and make more, but at what cost? I guess there are pros and cons to it. :(

Edit: If y’all wanna brag about having no life, I’m happy for you. But I’m gonna die on this hill that 15 PTO is not enough.

I had to stop filling out a job application, because it was just taking too much time! Does anyone else give up on filling out what turns into a really long process?

Understanding that office work is much more technical. I just don't get why we are treated better than the warehouse workers when they are the ones putting on a sweat fest all day.

Looking for a new job in my field but anything that requires an advanced degree, all the postings have a salary range of $50-$60k, and that’s on the high end. I did some exploring in other fields (no intention of applying) and they’re all the same. Want 5-7 years experience, advanced degrees, flexible hours, need recommendations, but then the salary is peanuts. It doesn’t seem to matter what you’re going into.

Do employers really expect to get qualified candidates doing this or are they posting these jobs specifically so no one will apply and they can hire internally?

A recruiter who recently interviewed me, asked if it was ok to call me up yesterday to confirm some information they got from one of my references. I said sure, and waited for the call. The reference they had spoken to, was my former boss from 2015-2017. Lets call him Dave. Me and Dave were good buddies. Atleast i thought so.

A little backstory: I have actively applied to jobs for about seven months, both in my field, and in the field im working now. I have called all my references, to confirm if i could have them as references when applying. Now, i was unsure if i should include Dave in this list, since its more than five years since he was my boss, but i called him to get his opinion (lives in a different town).

It felt great catching up! He told me that even if this was some time ago, he would be happy to help me out, and after some talk about work, we talked about golf, life in general etc, for a LONG time. Ok then, i cant not have him on the list i thought. I talked to him again about one week before the recruiter called him.

Since i started applying, i have gotten close to "the finish line" on four different occations. Four times, recruiters have asked me for my references "as a formality, before we send you an offer", and every time the offer has never come. One recruiter even told me she was looking forward to working with me etc. Other times i werent the right fit, and thats ok.

Now, the recruiter who called me told me that Dave had "an attitude" and had said:

"he put me up as a reference? Thats wierd..."

"its too long since ive talked to the guy, i cant really remember"

"all i really remember is that he went on sick-leave, and his conract expired"

some other stuff i cant remember now

I was shocked. I thanked the recruiter for calling me about this, and cleaned up the situation.

For clarification; i think i was sick for two weeks before my contract expired, whereas Dave told the recruiter "long-term" sick-leave which implies 6+ months in my country.

I mostly want to call Dave up because i am angry and confused. I am aware that this might not be the smartest move, so im asking you reddit; have you been in a similiar situation? What did/would you do?

I'm 39 years old and I've worked a lifetime of bad jobs. After finally going back to school and getting my bachelor's I got offered a job in another state so I accepted and drove across the country assuming it would be worth it. It was not, it was a nightmare and I was forced to quit. I'm now in a random state I never wanted to be in, with no job, and honestly I don't even want one. I'm so done with bad jobs and I'm running out of hope that I'll ever find a good one.

In other words I'm depressed about being unemployed but I'm equally depressed about eventually having another bad job. The only thing in the world I really want to do is write and I have been sending out my books to publishers but that never seems to work. I'm sure eventually I'll give up on my dreams again and take another job I don't want and I just feel too old to keep going through this.

So I had a trial shift down at my local cafe, 3 hours unpaid word. I get there and they tell me to step aside while they work. So I’m there sitting like an idiot for 10 minutes doing nothing. Fast forward the owner let’s call her aleesha. Aleesha tells me how to do dishes. I do dishes and everything is going fine. After the dishes are dried I ask aleesha “where should I put these” when I tell you she gave me the most disgusting look, it looked like she just smelt road kill. She says to me with a disgusting expression “open your eyes and look” so I look around and can’t find where to put it because it’s my first ever time being in the kitchen. She then again gives me a disgusting look and walks out the run food out. So I simply just left and blocked her number. I was there for about 2 hours when I left, I am there to learn and work, I am not being paid so you can get fucked if you think I’m going to cop bullshit like that for free.

My life was turned upside down so they could save 15k? That’s it?

I'm 30 next month and was still trying to find out what I want to do with as a base job.

Only just recently found out USPS mail people can make $50-80k depending on Location and THIS would've been GREAT to know if I had known about it in high school.

We all focused on jobs that required a degree and I knew college wasn't for me.

I have been handling this very stressful job the last 2 years. I finally gave my 2 weeks notice. My boss wants 30 days notice, he says I hold a responsible position and that 30 days is the norm. He also wants me to continue part time after my 30 days. I really have come to hate this job. I have been scared several times. I am a nice person and my boss is super nice too. I don’t want to hurt anyone. At the same time I want to be done with this job once for all. How should I handle this situation? I will appreciate any input. Thanks.

Thanks a lot for all the responses! I live in the US. I live in an at-will State. Never signed a contract. I will be able to find another job pretty soon, I may have to take a pay cut which i don’t mind. I will be super careful with my next job to make sure it is a good match for me.

I will stick to my two weeks. Thanks again.

I work in marketing, more specifically in the social media area. I have what I would consider a lot of experience for what is now a newer field of work, and I had been at my last company for over two years. I really enjoyed my job but knew there was no room for me to grow, and there had been some recent pain points that had me searching (not so seriously) for a new opportunity. I heard back rather quickly from a company that really peaked my interest and the interview process went extremely fast. I accepted the offer from the new company as it was a large promotion for me and a pay that was a big jump. I was set to start in two weeks, they did take a while to get back to me and I found that odd. I actually ended up having to email the company multiple times just to figure out where to go on my first day, I just needed an address and a start time. I looked past these yellow flags because what else was I supposed to do? My first day was rather odd and unconventional for a first day in this role, as I have had multiple jobs in this exact role. My second day was remote and my next day in office was Monday and on Tuesday they let me know that I wasn’t a good “fit” and they realized they didn’t “have the time to train me and the learning curve was too big as I am not as well versed in apparel.” Note: My last job was in the restaurant industry, but I’ve worked in apparel marketing on two different occasions. I am personally still processing all of this, and I am feeling really small that I left a stable job of two years just to be fake hired essentially. Has anyone ever heard of this happening? I feel like it’s almost criminal what they did, but I’m an at-will employee. Mostly needed to rant, but also any insight would be great.

Nobody is hiring right now. 3 years ago if I applied for 3 jobs 2 would call back. Hiring managers are making it look like they’re hiring but every post you’re seeing is lie.

We’re in a recession, good luck out there.

Edit: Computer science degree

I can’t even believe it. Three weeks ago I was a leasing agent making $19 an hour, on-site working 10-6pm, working every weekend, dealing with terrible people everyday.

Now I’m working in talent acquisition/ marketing, making $58k (may not seem like a lot but for me that’s life changing), 8:30-4:30 M-F, it’s SUPER close to my home and it’s 3 days wfh. Amazing company with great benefits and a great work culture. I’m 22 years old and didn’t even finish college (going back next spring though!) and have been working so hard to try to get to this point. I’m so proud of the moves I made to get here.

One of my coworkers has been quiet quitting for a long time. But we're basically in a workplace where people are unfireable (government job). His boss does not seem to want to confront him about slacking, so instead, she gives his work to me and makes everything about "we" and "us" instead of "him".

Instead of telling him directly, for example, "hey PERSON X, why aren't you responding to my e-mails?" She'll e-mail both of us and say "Hey Team, why aren't you guys responding to my e-mails?" (When it's very obviously him, not me.)

When he decides not to do his work, she just gives his work to me.

Honestly, I don't care if he quiet quits -- that's his business. But when his refusal to do work is falling on my table, that's where I start to see things getting problematic. How would you deal with this situation? Telling on him is not a good option, we are equals in the workplace and he considers me a friend.

EDIT: Wow, so many responses! Yes perhaps my use of "quiet quitting" wasn't the right choice of words. My coworker came into my office on Friday and told me he doesn't "give a f***" about this job but he feels powerful because he feels "unfireable". He spends the entire day working on his own stuff (he has a few side jobs that he does). Our boss seems to be intimidated by him and takes the easy way out - instead of giving work to someone who's going to push back, she'll dump it on others instead. Firing someone is an extremely complicated and long process here, and probably not something she wants to go through. The boss is in her third trimester of pregnancy and getting ready to go on maternity leave. My coworker and I have similar job descriptions so it's easy to give his work to me. Addressing the "friend" issue: yeah, I don't really know if "friend" was the right word here either. But we're equals and I guess you could say "friendly" to each other. Coworker brings me baked goods sometimes, has invited me to get-togethers, things like that. Situation really sucks.

So to cut to the chase, I graduated from high school a year ago and desperately need a job right now. My only parameter is that I don't want a job that would require me to talk a lot/sell snake oil to anyone. I'm just really antisocial so I'm wondering if anyone knows a job I could do which doesn't require more than a "hello" and a "goodbye". Thank you in advance

Everyone always says LinkedIn is essential to job searching. It feels quite overrated to me. I've never seen much benefit out of using it but I do see a lot of downsides:

It's terrible for privacy

The website is always slow and laggy

Job recommendations are often not relevant

Many jobs are spam/scams

Unless you spend time optimizing a profile, it won't get many views

Lots of recruiters waste time

The main feed is full of posts that are not worth reading

Companies don't even hire the people that use easy apply

It's basically what Facebook was years ago

Anyone else feel like LinkedIn isn't useful for job searching anymore?

My supervisor was showing me how the phones and systems work today and we were having conversation in between calls. Did the scheduling which I actually had a say in, and told me this gem. ‘Just so you know, family comes first. This is just a job and we’re all replaceable. I’ll work with you and be flexible’ I can’t believe that after all of these years of shit treatment, I’m here. I’m still in shock.

Will they even hire me? Will people be rude to me because of my weight? I’ve been getting tired at 11am. My schedule is so backwards so an overnight job makes sense.

*** update*** I applied shortly after I posted this due to all the positivity I was receiving! Fingers crossed 🤞

I would also like to add that I gained weight when I broke my leg and dislocated my ankle while pregnant, followed by a C-section a month later. I know how to get into shape y’all, it’s just not as easy anymore. A couple of ppl are taking this opportunity to take jabs but I really do appreciate mostly everyone being so supportive ❤️

It’s been 6 months of being unemployed (due to a layoff), interviews, rejections, ghosting, financial stress (no severance), etc and I finally got an offer that I’m very excited about! I signed a couple minutes ago and it feels rather surreal. I wanted to thank everyone here, reading about your experiences in the job market have encouraged me to keep going, reminding me that I wasn’t the only one laid off and I’m not alone. Anyone reading this who is struggling with finding a new role, I’m hoping it happens for you soon!!

Edit: this is my first real post! Can I thank everyone individually for your well wishes?! Also - I will say I applied to this role 5 times and got rejected every time (within hours of applying). Ended up applying to an junior role and that’s how they noticed me (don’t think this is normal though), I changed my resume to add core skills and descriptors for each bullet point - resulted in many more responses, and lastly I fibbed a bit (minor) in the screening process (working with one data set vs another, not a big deal I learned it while I was interviewing).

I was contacted via email by a girl from a company. She first asked for my portfolio and then tasked me with a editing project for their Instagram reel. She said after this test I will he givrn an internship.

So I did and mailed it to her last night. And now I got the rejection mail from her just now.

What is this scam? The video is not uploaded in their Instagram yet. But I am angry how they could just take such a test and reject me right after their work is done? What should I do?

I work from home as an interpreter which requires me to log on to a system and wait for calls to come through. I drink a lot of water as well and need to go pee often but it is never more than 5 mins at a time. It is mostly about 1 min or 2 tops since my office is close to my bathroom. My job is threaten to fire me because I take too many breaks. I drink a lot of water due to the medication that I am taking. Should I submit something from my doctor explaining this to save my job?

Sorry if this is not the right place to post, I'm just getting fed up lately. I am 33 and was in treatment for a solid 13 months for aggressive stage 2 breast cancer; IVF before chemo, 6 rounds of intense chemo, 18 rounds of immunotherapy, a double mastectomy, reconstruction surgery, and I just finished everything and got my port removed end of April. I had complete remission thankfully but it seems like all people ask me now is what I'm doing for work now and when I'm going to be looking for a new job (I used to be a software engineer but my old job wasn't very understanding of my medical situation so I left). When I tell them I'm not sure, and that I just want to take a break and maybe travel/enjoy life after cancer treatments I get a bunch of awkward silences and disapproving looks.

A couple of my husband's friends told me I should start the job hunt sooner than later because it's tough nowadays..even some of my relatives told me to stop being so "aimless" and get back to work. I have only just finished treatments 2.5 months ago, still coming to terms with missing parts of my chest, and still worried about recurrence. Plus my husband and I own a couple rental properties and we are doing okay with his income plus rental income. After this whole ordeal I just feel there is more to life than work, but I guess most people don't think so? Thankfully my husband is supportive of me, but I'm not sure how to respond to other people anymore..

EDIT: Wow thank you so much everyone for all the support!! I'm really grateful for the responses on here..I've always struggled with self-esteem issues/caring what others think, but I definitely should try not to. Maybe the people I mentioned are just trying to make friendly conservation or think I'm totally "back to normal" because I mention remission, but I just wish people would stop tying what you do with who you are to such an extent.

Also yes to those who were wondering, I do live in the U.S. (no surprise). Anyways, sending support to all those fellow cancer survivors/those currently going through cancer out there, I know it's tough. I still have lingering symptoms from chemo and definitely get tired more easily than before.

Thought this would be a funny moment to share with Reddit.

After leaving my sales job at an E-commerce site in May and struggling to find any form of work, my financial situation has gotten into a tough spot and my motivation to continue job hunting is at an all time low.

I just applied to be a crew member at my local McD’s. To be honest I’m really hoping I get hired and am actually really excited to work a job that’s just simpler and more genuine, even if it’s only for a bit.

I made $130,000 last year before taxes and now I am praying that I can land this job where I work for minimum wage at a fast food place. That’s the best way I can describe the current job market right now.

Anyways, fingers crossed!

Edit: didn’t expect this to get as many comments as it did, anyways. For the people being rude, I worked in restaurants for several years before I began my sales career. I’ve worked at fast food chains before. I’ve worked back of the house and front of the house. I worked in the vacation industry as well for a long time in various customer facing roles. I’ve had plenty of jobs and have been around the block several times. I know what they entail, I didn’t just pop out of my mothers womb as a salesperson. Also, anyone saying working a busy shift at McDonalds is more stressful than my last job, how can you know that? I can guarantee 10000% that you are shitting out of your mouth and have no idea what you’re talking about.

Second edit: I reached out to my previous employer showing interest in coming back after taking a break. They offered me a better job than my previous one and I start on Monday. I'm surprisingly very relieved and excited to get back to the work world after taking time to work on myself. Thanks to everyone who commented and provided valuable insight, even the ones who didn't say very nice things. I wish everyone the best of luck in their careers and personal endeavors. I will not be editing this post further to respond to anyone. My last insight will be this: keep your head up and things will always work out for you, optimism goes a long way.

I have a job and I am very happy. That being said, a lot of the jobs out here want experience. Even retail. I applied for a temporary part time bank teller position a long time ago that wanted a bachelor's degree. My aunt worked those types of jobs in the 80s with just a high school diploma.

Same thing with all these schools and career colleges online pushing things like medical coding. Every single job posting I have seen for medical coding asks for medical coding experience, usually at least 3 years. Doing an online training program is fine, but the companies have to be willing to hire people without experience and train them.

If we can subsidize corn, why can't we subsidize training programs? The government could financially incentivize hiring people who graduate from training programs just like they do with Work Opportunity Tax Credit.

Why aren't our leaders interested in investigating why so many people with degrees and training are struggling? Wouldn't it make sense to ask why these companies advertise the same jobs for years straight? Or claim they need someone with a bachelor's degree to be a receptionist?

Just found out this morning that my employer is forcing my boss into early retirement presumably to cut costs. He was a 20+ year veteran with the company. I have been with the company 2 years and I was brought in specifically to be his mentee and take over for him when he retired (planned for July 2024)

This morning we found out they are giving him a severance package and forcing him out the door. I will take over tomorrow. This is in the transportation industry. I currently make about $48,000/year. I’m not sure what his salary is. I really want to avoid getting lowballed by my company, especially since my boss was forced out to “cut costs.” My expectation is a raise to between 60-70k. Probably closer to 70k. It feels a bit like I am in the driver’s seat now since they have no one else to fill this position unless they go with an outside hire.

What is the best way for me to approach this situation?

Thanks

At my current job, they have a policy that we only get 59 minutes of bathroom breaks per month. They track that time by making us go into an Unscheduled Break status whenever we leave our desk when it's not one of our fifteen minute breaks or our lunch break. I work at a call center, so leaving my desk without going into Unscheduled Break means risking getting a call when I'm not there to take it. If we use Unscheduled Break for more than 59 minutes over the course of a month, we get written up, and management will even talk about terminating you for repeated offenses.

At first I didn't think much about it. 59 minutes sounds like a lot of time on paper, and I was usually able to put off having to use the bathroom until I had my scheduled break every two houra. But then I got out of training and was given a weird schedule that makes me wait up to 3 to 4 hours between my first break and lunch break. Suddenly, waiting until lunch to use the bathroom became a lot harder, and I started having to use Unscheduled Break almost every day.

If I rush, I can usually use the restroom and be back in my desk in about three minutes. So if I use one three-minute bathroom break a day, I'll run out of Unscheduled Break time after about nineteen days, leaving me with eleven or twelve days where I either have to suffer without being able to use the bathroom or get written up for leaving my desk with no Unscheduled Break time left, and eventually get fired for it.

EDIT: YES, I CALCULATED THE DAYS I WORK PER MONTH WRONG. PLEASE STOP BRINGING IT UP.

What can I do in this situation? I've heard that OSHA has rules in place to make sure workers have reasonable access to use the restroom, but does the fact that we're given 59 minutes of Unscheduled Break over a 30-31 day period count as "reasonable"?

EDIT #2: TO EVERYONE TELLING ME TO PEE IN A BOTTLE AND DISPLAY IT WHERE MANAGEMENT CAN SEE, I WORK FROM HOME. THE ONLY PERSON THAT WILL EFFECT IS ME.

EDIT #3, 4, 5, AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING: They'll know if I'm not at my desk because it automatically puts me back in Available status 25 seconds after I hang up a call. If I go into a non-work status where I can't get calls, management immediately knows about it.

I can't bring my computer into the bathroom because it has to be physically connected to my router at all times. Being on wifi is an instant write up. Also, everything is on the computer and the internet. There is no physical phone.

I can't use a wireless or bluetooth headset because they've programmed the computer to only work with the wired headsets they give us.

I can't put the borrower on hold and use the bathroom because hold times are limited to two minutes. If I don't pick back up and "check on" the borrower once every two minutes, they deduct points from the call.

For example, I’m not always good at verbally communicating what I know. And I may be a bit slow at first, but once I gain work experience, I shine. If I get the chance.

Yesterday the business I am a manager at received a counterfeit $20 bill. My general manager told me to keep it in the safe and give it back as change next time someone pays with a $100 bill. This is a federal crime. Using counterfeit currency with the intent to defraud an individual. This request goes against our company's established protocol. The request was made in an office with audio recording. I'm obviously not going to give it to someone but this isn't the first time he's asked me to do something legally or ethically questionable. What do I do?

I keep hearing "job market is red hot", "so many jobs out there", "jobs report shows hiring everywhere". "Desperate for talent".

Well forgive me if I say I think it's all bulls***. Am I the only one who can't even get an interview? I'm down to trying entry level roles basically anywhere. It's pointless.

Literally the only place that gave me an interview turned out to be some shady MLM type organization.

EDIT: I see some comments saying I'm probably a whiny tech bro who doesn't want to work making french fries. Nope, I am applying to entry level just about anything, in any field, at this point. It's the same story.

Also, I just want to say, if you do 40 hours of honest work a week and you can't afford to live and by that I mean rent a basic room and eat and pay medical bills, the system is broken, not you.

My doctor called me back since he found a few things alarming on my blood work. I told my new job of two weeks that I need to leave early this Thursday and my boss told me he wants a photo of me at the doctors ? I think it’s ridiculous. I’m second guessing my employment here and wonder if I should leave.

On ZipRecruiter, it’s a gig I’m qualified for but that line has me concerned (it’s for a lawyers office).

I am really good at my job and have a good reputation at the places I have worked. But I absolutely hate having to provide references when applying to new positions.

Hate. It.

I'm never close enough to anyone that I work with to feel comfortable asking them to vouch for me, nor advertising to anyone at work that I am applying elsewhere.

I was laid off in January from a six figure role and it’s the first time in thirteen years I’ve been unemployed.

In three months, I’ve had four interviews and a dozen rejections, after applying to over 600 roles. I want to pull my hair out, I feel so beyond defeated.

I’m on benefits, food stamps and unemployment. Today they just notified me I make too much on employment to qualify for food stamps. What??!!

Applying for jobs is a job in itself. It’s definitely not like it used to be, even two years ago, it’s wild. Recruiters are so out of touch; do this, not this, but make sure this, but never that! I just can’t. I feel like a failure. I’m 32, no husband or family. I live with family and I’m living off of my savings.

I feel depressed. I don’t have a degree and I feel like a ghost on the job market right now. I don’t know what to do. If I go back to school, I lose unemployment benefits. It’s like I’m between a rock and a hard place. I have no direction.

LET ME MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR As noted above, I have a savings account that is dwindling and I’m living off off. Am I in the most dire of situations from an unemployed perspective, no things can absolutely be worse and I am blessed. I am allowed to feel sad, depressed, worried, and anxious about my situation. Comments about me not knowing how to manage money or living beyond my means are blindfully diagnostic and frankly rude. I’m not sure what person loves to sit and watch money go out and not come in. Additionally, yes I qualify for benefits in my state because I have no income. Not sure why that’s so hard for anyone to understand. The nastiness some people exude is so unnecessary.

it honestly just feels kind of insulting. I will probably not be hired. I will probably not even be looked at.

I’ve spent hours on this resume for you, the employer. I come back to edit it every month or so so that you, the employer, may like it better.

And then you ask me to forget all the time I spent on my resume, because you want me to literally spell it out for you.

You want me to sit here and copy paste, with your clunky UI that will probably not even save my progress if the page is open too long, for 20 minutes, when you probably won’t even give me a fraction of that time.

Because… why? What will this do that my resume does not? Why do I need to apply according to your system? What is so special about you that I’ll give you this much time? And you want a cover letter, too? Does my time revolve around you already?

Feels so disrespectful to my time. I cannot think of one good reason I should sit here and copy paste every single job experience when it is on my resume already. Just read the fucking document I prepared.

My job is mostly okay, I'm very good at it. Unfortunately every year I have this problem where I simply can't book holiday. Usually I have to spend it all in march before turn over when they absolutely can't fob me off any longer on the issue.

I have to fight tooth a nail for it every year for the last 5 years. Even when I book in January I never get Halloween off, my anniversary, or my partner's birthday, however this year they haven't even given me my birthday off despite me attempting to book in 2021. I have 169 hours of unspent holiday and once again it looks like it all has to go into march and I'm so tired of it.

Basically they have a policy where two people can't be off at the same time. So the seniors pick up their holidays way in advance with TOIL and then no one who doesn't have a plan at the start of the year can book. They don't buy your holiday time from you either you just lose it and I have lost it nearly every year. I'm really frustrated but is it worth quitting over? I'm tired going around the HR loop everytime I want a day off

I work in an office whose hours are 9-530. Most days, I’m out of the office door at like 5:25 maybe to wait for the elevator.

Today my supervisor asks “is there a reason you leave early everyday?” I told her I’m usually a few minutes early and start right away so I just leave a couple min early too. She ultimately asked me to stay in the office till 5:30.

Thoughts on supervisors caring about 5 minutes?

Edit: another reason this rubs me so wrong is 90% of staff is remote. I am the only one required to come to the office and my supervisor chooses to come in 3-4 days a week, but she’s not required to. I really doubt all the remote workers are working until 5:30 on the dot. But I’m the only person who is monitored.

Edit: I’m salary. There is no policy handbook on tardiness. There is no HR.

I have never understood this. What, are the unemployed supposed to just curl in a ball and never get another job? People being unemployed is not a black or white thing at all and there can be sooooo many valid reasons for it:

Company goes through a rough patch and slashes admin costs

Person had a health/personal issue they were taking care of

Person moved and had to leave job

Person found job/culture was not a good fit for them

Person was on a 1099 or W2 contract that ended

Merger/acquisition job loss

Position outsourced to India/The Philippines

Person went back to school full time

Sure there are times a company simply fires someone for being a bad fit, but I have never understood the bias against hiring the unemployed when there are so many other reasons that are more likely the reason for their unemployment.

Only 10 days??? What if I want PTO to tack onto a long weekend? Or go to Europe in the summer? Or to have any kind of Christmas break later in the year? Or just a random PTO day for mental health?

Location: America. Obviously.

I worked at a ice cream shop that is located in a small town. Been working here for 2 months and everything was going smoothly. Today as I was scooping ice cream for a customer, I accidentally dropped it. My manager later came and asked to come to his office. I was fired on the spot. He said something along the lines of “our ice cream is too expensive and we can not risk losing them” so he fired me instead. Like wtf?? Ice cream here costs $5 a scoop. It is not fucking expensive. And fired for a simple and common mistake like dropping an ice cream? Am I overthinking??

Who in the world decided that "we" "should" or "must" have a LinkedIn? Sure, it used to be cool, but now it's way past the prime and is on the same trajectory as Myspace, Yahoo!, Facebook, etc. and so forth.

Have I found work on LinkedIn? Yes, at times. But nowadays it is a wasteland and I am way better off talking directly with actual contacts, using old-school methods, and directly applying. Heck, my best job ever at a patent law firm was posted on Craigslist!

It's not that LinkedIn is inherently evil (?). But with the politicization, stressful sidebar articles and posts with half-baked opinions about the economy (even in great times), and class warfare, it is just super annoying. Fake profiles and jobs, ghosting by 95% of recruiters who contacted me first, and the general soul-less and slimy, dirty feelings it gives me caused me to deactivate a long time ago.

It is time for genuine job posters and seekers to join the revolution against the scammy, scummy cesspool that is LinkedIn.

So after spending 16 years working in hospitality management, 50-65 hours a week, nights, weekends, and holidays, I have finally managed to break into a "normal" work schedule. I get to attend regular family events. I get to spend evenings and weekends with my wife and daughter. I get to see the shows and participate in the activities that I always wanted, but never could due to schedule conflicts. It's been a long time coming, and I worked really hard to earn it, but I finally did it and couldn't be more ecstatic.

I always see people post about how their lives are in a rut, or they're struggling with work and life balance, or they're not happy with how things are going. I even see people posting about how they hate their Monday through Friday jobs. I just wanted to bring some attention to other perspectives. I spent most of my adult life working while other people were relaxing/engaging in recreation, and now I couldn't be happier to finally join them!

If you are like I was, keep your head up, stay positive, set short and long term goals, hold yourself accountable, and don't be afraid to ask for help. You can accomplish anything if you want it badly enough, and are willing to work for it!

How should I go about this? I work in the field doing specialized work and there is not anyone to cover me, matters are always considered a priority or urgent, and I am told that even request one day off to let them know a month in advance.

It’s getting real tiring and I am finding it difficult to even have time to interview for other roles. What should I do?

I finally got a job! This is the first job I have gotten on my own without help! I’m so happy!

"After careful deliberation, the team is considering other candidates whose background and experience more closely align with the overall qualifications."

It was probably an internal candidate.

They just posted the job "to go through the motions".

They're just saying this to save face, it has nothing to do with you.

They never clicked on any of the links to your website / portfolio.

Your background and experiences are SPOT ON for the required qualifications.

You are good enough. You are talented, skilled, and qualified.

They just never looked.

None of my friends are available right now but I wanted to say it to someone so thats it.

It is ingrained in most of us that we need to be productive at all times. Society frowns on the able man who does no work for a full day.

As free-thinking and free-living individuals we must allow ourselves time of leisure. This time of relaxation is what allows for real productive thought and abstract inspiration. This time may not directly benefit your organization but it does directly benefit the individual.

Leisure is the time that you come up with the shape of your consciousness. Who are you? Who do you want to be? How do you make your dreams a reality? To clearly see the steps required you must break down the large goals into smaller, attainable goals that lead up to the dream over time. This process requires extended durations of a relaxed mind. Without that time, you are likely to get stuck in the hamster wheel of labor like the majority of working people in America.

Use your paid time off.. and use it well.

It's kind of interesting to see how upset people get at the fact that I'm homeless.

Like tf did I do to you?

I've had people spit on me. Yell at me for being lazy. Claim that I'm on drugs. Say that I'm making my story up. Projections EVERYWHERE. And then, to top it off... when applying for a job, the disrespect for NOT taking people's disrespect. People get mad at me for standing up against any abuse. Man.... I swear, can't wait for the entire job system and it's narcissism ladder to collapse. The fact I have to deal with all this PLUS finding a job is ridiculous.

I work in a very niche field. My job is currently severely understaffed because a coworker is out on a LOA after a family death. I came back to work 1 week after my dad died and asked for 4 unpaid days off in September (my dad died in September). They were granted, and I was granted two days off over Thanksgiving weekend. One day we were supposed to be closed so it should’ve been a nothingburger.

I called in two weeks ago due to a recurrent neck injury. My boss must have taken this to high offense because she promptly sent me a nasty email telling me I can’t have Thanksgiving weekend off (I work weekends, F-Sun). They also decided to open the office on Friday so I was put on the schedule for the entire weekend. An original stipulation of me taking this job was that I would occasionally need unpaid time off as it is, because I have two full time jobs. The previous manager approved this and said no problem.

HR has been useless and told me too bad, so sad, and I’m not eligible for FMLA. This was after my boss gave me lip service about how she wants to support me and how she cares so much. This would be my last time off until February.

I feel like this is a weird power play and I have no intentions of going to work. I’ve been really struggling with my dad’s death and unlike my other coworker, I’ve been denied a LOA, and I really need a break. It’s going to take them at least a year to replace me and up until my dad’s death, I’ve never called out and have been on time and do my job well. I’m disappointed in their response but oh well.

This is a vent I guess.

My father stayed at the same company for 40+ years and my mother 30. They always preached the importance of "loyalty" and moving up through the company was the best route for success. I listened to their advice, and spent 10 years of my life at a job I hated in hopes I would be "rewarded" for my hard work. It never came.

I have switched careers 3 times in the last 7 years with each move yeilding better pay, benefits and work/life balance.

My question.... Is the idea of company seniority still important?

Sometimes I can keep myself together through this job hunt, but this past week broke me. After 8 months and ~300 applications I finally got a screening interview. And it's now clear I've been ghosted after that.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. I have a BS in computer engineering from a really good school. I graduated with honors. I managed to get lucky and get a job after graduating 3 years ago in 2020. I absolutely hated it but stuck with it because it paid the bills. I have a security clearance. None of this shit matters.

I know this sounds like some first world problems, but I don't understand how my credentials get me fucking nothing.

I feel like a fraud, because how else can I get no responses from any place I apply to?

I was sold a bullshit promise. I bought it hook, line, and sinker. Engineering meant good stable employment for the rest of my life. I worked for 6 years to get my engineering degree (3 years part time, 3 years full time). I managed to get 3 years of DoD research under my belt. And here I am, 9 years later, and I'm crawling job postings for fucking retail positions that barely pay my groceries, much less my mortgage.

I feel like a parasite. My wife is working overtime trying to keep us afloat since losing my income.

I don't think I've ever felt this bad before. I feel like an anomaly of bad luck, a fraud, a failure, a waste of resources, a drain on people close to me, and like an entity that could just not exist anymore and not a god damn thing would change.

I'm terrified of losing the house we just bought 2 weeks before I lost my job. I'm terrified of one of us getting sick since we no longer have health insurance.

I can't handle this job market anymore. I just can't fucking do this anymore.

Addendum: I've been looking solely at computer hardware positions. Specifically digital design/verification and FPGA jobs (that's also what my previous experience at my DoD company was doing. Bitstream assurance).

I'd like to thank people for the kind words and the avenues to try. I've been told computer hardware is niche enough that it hasn't been hit as hard as other areas, but from speaking to folks it sounds like it has. Hearing so much affirmation from everyone that it's not a 100% me problem, but that the job market really is this bad across the board has me feeling a little less down on myself.

Addendum 2: I'm trying to respond to everyone I can. I didn't expect my depressive screaming into the ether to be this popular. I'm feeling a little better this afternoon after reading all the encouraging words, different fields to look into, and commiserating with y'all in the same position. Seriously, you folks are the best.

I live in a very high cost of living area and even here in California, you are lucky to make $25 an hour with a college degree. However when I do research on average wages I find that the average hourly wage is over $30 an hour. Where area all these jobs? Seems like fake statistics.

Im currently working in a pharmaceutical company making 57k as a level 1 scientist. After job hunting for 5 months i got a job offer for 78k plus 2 k sign on bonus with a bad reputed company. I gave my 2 weeks noticed and my company offered me 70k plus 2-3% increments in march and the option with work ot sat. The new company is 1 and half hour travel time and is required more than 8hrs per day with heavy workload and stress. Current company is less stress and closer to home and normal working working hrs.

Hello, I’m looking to get a bit of advice. My employee smells extremely bad, and it’s definitely body odour. I’m unsure how to approach this or what my options are. I feel like I have to be culturally sensitive incase it’s due to her culture. It is clear she does not wear deodorant. She’s a great employee, and I don’t want to offend her but summers almost here and it’s getting worse…any suggestions? Get HR involved? I also don’t want to put myself at risk. Any suggestions would be great.

Copied from somewhere else (Qora), not my words, but I think many will nod their heads at this. US context.

“I grew up in the suburbs. I used to think that I could write a prescription for a poor man: ‘Get a job, save your money, pull yourself up by the bootstraps.’ I don’t believe that anymore. I was ignorant to the experiences of poor people. I’d invite anyone to come and meet the people who live in this neighborhood. Right now we are surrounded by working poor people. These are the people who sell your tools at Sears, and fix your roofs, and take care of your parents, and mow your lawns, and serve your meals. They’re not getting a living wage. There’s no money left to save. There’s nothing left if they get sick. Nothing left if their car breaks down. And God forbid they make a mistake, because there’s nothing left to pay fines or fees. When you’re down here, the system will continue to kick dirt in your face. You can’t pull yourself up when there’s nothing to grab onto. We aren’t paying our brothers and sisters enough to live. We want them to serve us, but we aren’t serving them.”

Disclaimer: this is more of a rant of frustration post

I’m having trouble getting a real job. I graduated in 2021 with a mechanical engineering degree. I’ve had internships while in school.

In the mean time I’ve worked at hotels and gyms, and now a contract utility job that pays $23 /hr. I apply to jobs in my field, but now they don’t even have the decency to respond with a rejection email.

How am I supposed to enter the work force if they obviously don’t want to hire someone with 3-5 years experience in one specific role.

Eventually only fresh grads will be available, what then ?

Edit: they extended my PIP indefinitely and are evaluating me on a weekly basis to ensure quality of work doesn’t decline. They’re encouraging me to apply for other available roles in the company that would be a better fit for my strengths. Seems like it wasn’t a conspiracy to fire me, but may be one to keep me accountable while I look for another position. Thanks to everyone who commented and shared their kindness and their stories with me.

26f working for an engineering firm for 2 years. Had 2 promotions before depression got really bad and impacted work performance. Got put on a performance improvement plan at the end of June and had 60 days to improve. Expectations were vague and some of them I would already do just not consistently. I asked my supervisor via email if we could quantify the expectations so that at the end of the 60 days I know if I improved enough. She ended up giving me a call and talking about how some of the expectations may not apply directly, or that some of it was copy pasted into the document. We just had our 60 day review call and was told “I saw improvement just not a lot, which may be tricky because it’s not really quantifiable” and “you’re doing what you’re told to do but you’re not doing it on your own without being asked” I’m already applying to different positions but this feels kinda sketchy. Would they be able to fire me for not meeting these vague expectations that I specifically requested to be quantified? It just seems unfair and that I was set up to fail. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. If you made it to the end of this post, thank you for reading.

In my current job, this happened recently.

I’m in a team of four people who work in the field performing surveying and collecting geospatial data. We have no tools except for our own cell phones, pens and paper maps.

Coming from an IT/GIS background I quickly developed some apps and other tools we could use in the field. I also showed my bosses how it would massively speed up our production and remove the need for revisits (our bosses often change the metrics for our work on the fly, requiring us to go back out and do it all over again).

My system would have increased productivity 400% by my most conservative estimates. And it would cost a mere $2000 to implement across the whole team.

The CEO made nice noises about it, asked me to draw up a report and cost/benefit analysis. I did. He later admitted to never reading it. Told me to send it to him again with a request for everything I needed (I needed exactly two things. For him to make a GIS admin email account, and for company finances to pay for the new service).

He ghosted me. Completely. Never heard anything back. Meanwhile there was a major fuck up at the managerial level that not only meant a months worth of work (for four guys) was worthless, but we had to re-do it all in less than a week. My system would have prevented this.

And it did. For me. I redid my work in two days and spent the rest of that week chilling while my coworkers and bosses ran around freaking out.

I keep my tools to myself now. I do about 1/5 of the hard work of my counterparts, but enjoy the full pay. I finish my work early and submit it in the same timeframe as my coworkers. No one knows, and the bosses are apparently fine with it.

My coworkers are aware of my tools and would like to use them - I help them out occasionally, where it won’t impact my own time unduly - but after this last nonsense with the CEO, I just tell them to take it up with him. They won’t, so they’re stuck using paper maps and taking weeks to do days of work.

Sad.

I have been so worried the past month, my savings are less than £800.

I just got a call for a conditional offer, I’m so beyond excited. I just wanted to share.

Edited: Thank you all so much for the kind words and encouragement I truly appreciate it ❤️. I had no one to share the news with, so I thought I’d send it into the void, your support means more than you know :)

Original post here: Job messaged me back, asking me to do another Business case for them and I really dont want to. : jobs (reddit.com)

I emailed the team to let them know I was more than happy to continue the interview process but would not be doing an additional Business Case. The very nice HR lady talked to me for a bit trying to work through it but ultimately, the decision was a new Business Case had to be done, despite me already proving to them that I knew my stuff.

I had previously interviewed with the 2nd in charge and a handful of others for my other Biz case and random interviews throughout the process last year, so the "reason" I had to do a new Biz case was because the big boss was not in the last one. Some of my points that HR couldn't really answer were.

WHY was he not there last time?

Why can he not just review my last biz case and see all the things that came true that I said it would?

I was told I got nothing but good feedback and the 2nd in command (the hiring manager) really wanted me for the role.......if that's the case, does the big boss not trust the 2nd in command that he hired?

I stood my ground and told them no new Biz case would be done, so I was told that would mean I was effectively bowing out. My upcoming interviews this week were cancelled, and I let them know if they don't hire anyone and need consultation work in the future that they knew where to reach me.

I am not mad at them, seems like a classic case of a startup not having all its ducks in a row and tripping over itself, and I am lucky that I already have a great job......but man...what a pain

This is my first ever job so I am really in a pickle right now. Any advice would be appreciated.

I applied for a startup job which aligned quite well with my major and the very specific projects and thesis I did in college. Maybe that's why I got a callback. Interview was Monday which went quite well. Tuesday, I was emailed the offer letter and contract stating I start work (remotely) on Thursday. I spent Wednesday celebrating with my friends by watching the Spiderman movie. There was a group meet and greet call on Thursday where the new hires were introduced to each other and the existing employees. It was a newly formed division so there were less than 10 people. There was some talk of agendas and long term goals as well, with emphasis on needing to move fast since it's a startup.

I was closely following the emails that followed and was working on whatever deemed the most important agenda at the point. I wasn't super active on those email threads as I felt I didn't have anything productive to add yet which hadn't already been suggested. I didn't wanna present half baked ideas and look stupid.

Friday, i get an email from the boss saying that since I wasn't communicating well, he doesn't feel I am right for the fast paced environment of a start up and he terminated my contract. It hadn't been 3 days yet since my job started.

I feel this is very unjust since the offer came so quickly and I wasn't given time to adjust to the role. How can someone draw conclusion so quickly. Also to add that we weren't informed of any fixed hours. It's according to what the project demands since you know, it's a start up. But I still feel expecting someone to be on call 24*7 is not right. Moreover, I live in a different country from the boss with considerable difference in time zones. Somehow, the other employees from my country who are in the team are okay with being awake and working till 3-4am.

What is your opinion on this? Please guide me if there are any steps I take.

I’m so sick of making a new account for every fucking job I apply for just so they can sell my information

I’m so sick of the stupid, endless, and meaningless quizzes and personality tests that are there just to fuck with you

I’m so sick of reaching out and going above and beyond for every employer just to receive radio silence

I’m so sick of discovering in an interview that the job description and pay was an utter lie just to deceive people into applying

I’m so sick of employers never giving anyone new a chance

I’m so sick of waiting eons for government jobs to even tell you what the results of your interview was

I’m so sick of seeing the average pay for the same jobs go lower and lower as months go by and inflation goes up

I’m so sick of trying to find sneaky ways to make my resume and cover letters beat AI for just the slightest chance of having my application seen

I’m so sick of applying to hundreds of jobs and only running into failure and disappointment

I’m so sick of food and retail thinking I’m over qualified

I’m so sick of corporate thinking I’m under qualified

This feels endless. I’m losing all hope. Idk what else to do at this point. Ive been in complete job instability for a year now. My resume has even been tweaked by a professional and still nothing. I feel trapped.

Hi everyone,

I am a remote employee. I travel 3 1/2 hours to go to the main branch where my team is located about once every 3 months or so. Sometimes more frequently because I have a friend who lives in the area.

The last 2 times I was there visiting the office, my boss said he saw me sleeping during in person meetings.

The first time it happened I know there was a lot of wild fire smoke in the area, my eyes were BURNING, and I didn’t want to interrupt the meeting to announce that so I took a couple eyes to rub my eyes. So maybe he got confused by that?

The second time I drove up for a big team off site meeting that lasted 4 hours. I remembered our previous conversion so I made sure to be eating, taking notes, doodling, interacting with presenters or coworkers, or staring at the presenters.

Again, my boss said he and now other coworkers (we’re now a month past this meeting) said they say me briefly sleeping.

I am flabbergasted. I told him I WASN’T sleeping and I remember all of the presentations. I have notes. I don’t know how to prove I wasn’t. I asked if they noticed this happen any other times. He said it’s only been during in person meetings and never online. And it’s never been at my desk.

I asked all of my close friends and family. They have never noticed this. My book clubs haven’t. I haven’t ever had another job comment this.

I truly think I am being gas lit and probably railroaded.

My solutions next time I see them: A) Take detailed notes during meetings with a pen and paper B) Take off my glasses even though I can’t see but at least they can see my eyes C) Bring a fidget toy D) Insist on zoom meetings even when in person

Lmao when is it going to be my turn? I’m still waiting for my miracle story to happen.

Edit: OMG my time has come folks!! I just got hired by an excellent company! The Glassdoor reviews by the employees were something I’ve honestly never seen before and I can’t wait to be a part of it. I’m no longer unemployed!! My future managers are awesome and were super helpful throughout the process. The job comes with an excellent base salary plus really good benefits. It’s not a WFH position but if I do well enough, hybrid will be an option. I got rejected by companies who were offering a much lower base salary and was feeling dejected. Who knew that a better path was about to open to me. If it can happen to me, it can happen to y’all. Good luck folks! Sending good vibes to those who need it :D

Simply I'm not interested in what you had for dinner yesterday or your weekend plans. I don't want to be rude but seriously I'm not interested in at all and don't want to listen.

Work from home is an option sometimes but not always.

We take breaks twice a day, half an hour each, together with everyone in the office. So it's like 1 hour waste of time for me. I see no point in these empty conversations. When I just stay at my desk I feel bad. Help!!

Edit: Imagine playing basketball or ping pong for half an hour instead of sitting and talking. I would love that, but I'm sure some of you would hate it. And if someone comes and tells you "Oh you gotta do it for building a network, or oh you sometimes gotta do things you don't like", would it feel right?

Edit2: I'm not anti-social or introvert either. In my private life I'm totally opposite, can talk with "my friends" for hours, can totally listen their small talk because I care. But at work, I'm just there to make money. That's it.

*Update: she was fired and all is well. She called in late - my boss fired her over text. Lmao. The woman lost her shit and cussed my boss out - so that was a wrap. She then proceeded to screenshot our personal employee group chat messages and send them to our boss so that our boss “knows how we really feel”. (talk about how we hate our job ya know - off work topics). That woman was evil and toxic. All ended well. Forget her.

We are a company of private investigators. Before this employee began, we worked like a well lubed machine. Everyone just “gets” one another. We have less than 15 employees.

We had a new hire in January. It’s July now and boy is it terrible than ever. She does not listen, she cannot complete her job appropriately and has been coming into work drunk. Yes you read that! Drunk! She keeps a cup full of liquor on her desk and you can smell it on her breathe. She has outburst sometimes when you ask her to do basic tasks, then will claim we never told her to do something when we did (again we think she’s drunk on the job). Hell, we don’t allow her to email our attorneys because she doesn’t know how to be formal/professional. She isn’t getting how you should speak and act around them. For seven months, EVERYONE has been speaking about how difficult she is under our breath.

Today was the last straw. She lied about why she couldn’t make it to work to my boss and then called me, and asked me to lie to my boss for her if she asks.. I couldn’t do it. I told my coworkers what she said and we finally all dumped our hatred for her. I feel very bad. It was a solid, honest conversation. We all agreed she has to go. I volunteered to text our boss that she had lied to me and I was not okay with that. My boss called me and then I spilled all the tea.. as everyone sat in the conference room and listened on my phone conversation!! #wild

I’m up typing this and feeling horrible for what I did. For what we’re doing. My boss doesn’t wait around, she will be fired 9am sharp tomorrow.

This was tough. Was on a remote interview with the ceo, after so much hard work, finally got between me and one other person.

I put in so much research for my presentation, and it went 20 times better than I thought. Words started to flow like never before

Anyways, my mum is looking after the kids today (I live at home I'm 23 recent grad) and the nephew came in about the TV and started rebelling after trying to jokingly say go downstairs. He WOULDN'T leave kept getting louder and I just walked out as it was on my phone to the other room.

Felt like that BBC interviewer clip.

Their demeanor was very off after that and so was I.

The job market is hell for young people, clearly. But I feel really bad for people who are in their late 30s, 40s, 50s, maybe older doing menial jobs that pay 30-40k a year or less. What is going on? Are they surviving off a spouse's income?

EDIT: Some people are saying 50k isn't so bad. I guess it's subjective but I changed it anyway.

I just started this new job last Monday, it's a receptionist job at a medical clinic, very busy but fairly streamlined and I still have a lot to learn anyways.
Basically, I've just been watching training videos and doing my best to at least listen in on to conversations that the other receptionists were having with patients. I try to follow along with where they click and what they ask about but it's tough because they go through it pretty quickly and it's not their job to train me so they don't feel like they need to slow down.
My actual department manager is supposed to have been training me and hasn't been in all week until yesterday, Friday. She comes in and we work for a bit but she's still not really showing me what I need to do for simple things like the check-in process. And so we get a patient in and my manager is the kind of manager that pushes all of her work off to the underlings so she asked me to check in this new patient. I said, "Okay could you shadow me and make sure I'm getting all of her information correct?" My boss is frustrated now and repeats herself, for me to check this person in. I agreed to try on my own but I was really hesitant because I didn't know much about the scanners or paperwork or what information the techs needed or what the system needed but regardless I started to make my way through the process. However, my boss sensed my hesitancy and she reached over and shoved me towards the screen and said "Just do it". The patient was appalled and the other receptionist just hurried the patient over to her desk. I just sat dumbfounded for ten minutes that she had just put her hands on me like that and then I scurried off to take my break. And now I have all memorial weekend to wonder if I should go back on Tuesday or just ditch.

TL;DR: My boss who hasn't been training me like she was supposed to gets mad when I ask for help and physically shoves me in front of other staff and patients. Should I go back? Either way it's being reported to HR.

I've lost track of how many posts I've seen of people complaining because they quit and can't find something new.

This is not the job market to be unemployed.

I don't care how miserable you are, don't quit until you have a new job lined up.

Ask yourself, can I afford to pay my rent/mortgage if I'm unemployed for the next 2 years?

This was true even when the jobs market was in a good place for job seekers, so its absofuckinglutely true in this current employer leaning job market.

/rant

Edit: I didn't think I needed to say this, but some of you are pretty obtuse. Obviously there are outliers. If you have mental health issues, if you are in a high demand job and you're guaranteed to not be hunting long, if you have massive amounts of savings, if you can move back in with your parents, or if you are being abused or bullied on the job with no recourse, of course quit your job. This is meant for the vast majority of people that just hate their jobs or their boss or their coworkers and want out, but otherwise isn't doing damage to them mentally or physically.

28M So a little preface. I was working at a serious food manufacturing Company as a logistics Supervisor for 2 years and was upgraded to logistics manager for another 2 years. After about 4 years total, I decided I had enough With my boss harassing me about my monthly National Guard obligation that I just walked out one day. (Yes i understand this may be illegal but The company refused to handle it and i just wanted to cut ties)

Cut to about two months later (Today) I am still on the job hunt. I have sent out over 200 Job applications for similar roles and even entry level positions. I have had only one in person interview with a company. The company was another manufacturer ( I wont say which) but honestly they seem like a very good company and promising. I applied with the company on August 11 aand have had 5 interviews. 2 interviews with 4 VPs, one with the plant director, one with a recruiter and the final interview was at the plant 8+ hours away with the entire team and the team seemed awesome. Now i'm just waiting for either that dreaded email/phone call or that amazing one.

Now my curiosity is that is every one else looking for a job going through the same thing? Is it really this difficult? Is the hiring process for companies now going to 2+, 3+ even 4+ interviews? How do you deal with this job Market?

Seriously. "Oh I just would LOVE working here because blah blah blah and I’ve always DREAMED of being a cog in your total make rich people rich scheme" is so mentally draining. Don’t play the game. There are some advanced language models that can generate custom cover letters for you. With the right data (your resume and job description) they can generate a cover letter that is tailored to the job you’re applying to. The best part? You don’t have to write a single word. All you have to do is enter your data and the AI does the rest. OpenAI playground is one and there are others.

For me, writing the bullshit is the most demotivating part of applying for a job. So, if you are going to be sending out hundreds of applications, it may be worth giving AI a try. Also, you can use it to write email responses as well (even in foreign languages).

So, if you want to save yourself time and energy, give AI a try and let it write your cover letters and emails for you. Your resume and qualifications should speak for themselves.

Here are the prompts I use:

Job Description:

[Paste job description here]

Resume:

Cover letter:

14 years experience in the housing construction industry and just got laid off. This was a great job with a great company. I feel that the top managers who made the decision didn’t have all the info and have no idea how much value I bring to this company. Scared as hell. Too old for this shit.

I just got my first office job at a nonprofit. I don't have always deadline work; a lot of the time, I'm just taking notes for my boss on various current event articles so she can stay up to date. It's very clearly busy work. I struggle to focus pretty much every day that I'm not actively working on a grant proposal. (Which is most days.)

I know that some of the higher-ups are super busy, but...I can't be the ONLY one twiddling my thumbs. It's hard to judge, because my department is just me and my boss, but every time I walk by a colleague's cubicle, they're just in their email. There's no way everyone is emailing for 8 hours straight, is there??? But maybe that's how office work IS????

Please tell me everyone else is fucking off too. I can't fathom how anyone is finding shit to do here for 8 hours 5 days a week.

just a rant i guess

I graduated last year with a degree in computer science and have only got a couple contract jobs since then fixing wordpress sites. let’s just say it’s been going terrible and i only got 1 interview out of hundreds of applications. I was feeling so low one night , sobbing in bed at 3am I just picked up my phone and and applied to my local mcdonald’s.

I get a text a week later telling me to show up the next day at a hiring event between 11-3 with a pen . I patiently wait my turn amongst the high schoolers in sweatpants to be interviewed by a woman who has been sitting outside for 2 hours already beneath a tent on the sidewalk giving 7 minute interviews ones after the other. she’s clearly over it but when my turn comes i smile and act eager as she huffs over the gaps in my work experience. she said they’ll contact me within a week if they have an offer.

it’s been a week.

I know it’s my fault . I know I need to apply to 200 a week, I know there’s something better and smarter i should be doing but that was my last desperate gasp. I’m not any better or more qualified than the other 2000 applicants for any job. I can’t doordash i don’t have a car. what do mediocre people like me do?

Edit: thanks so much to everyone who took the time to read this and offer words of encouragement and advice. I read all of them and i feel some hope for my future again.

So I started my job today, first day of work. I work from 6 Am to 3pm. And i am not a morning person. But this job pays well and i like the work atmostphere. And the coworkers are really nice and they don't mind my stuttering, they dont make fun of me for that or my social awkwardness. Anyways, i got home, watched a show and then fell asleep. I slept til around 8:20 and when i woke up, i saw my clock and my sleep addeled brain thought it was 8:20 AM. I texted my boss and called him. He was at work still, and was like, "Anna, its 8:20 PM....?"

I'm such an idiot. But he thought it was hilarious and so did my coworkers. I think it kinda broke the ice a bit?

So I had a job interview earlier and I did a typing test as part of that process. I only got 35 wpm and couldn't move forward in the process. I've been practicing my typing for awhile and can type decently quick, if I don't feel pressured. Mainly, I'm wondering if anyone can actually type 50+ wpm or is it unrealistic? Hopefully this isn't a dumb question. 😅😂

Step 1: feed it the company’s “about us” page

Step 2: feed it the job ad your applying for

Step 3: generate custom resume for that specific job for that specific company.

Step 4: with that resume, have it generate specific cover letter for that specific company

Effortless custom resume and cover letter that 9 times out of 10 no one will read anyway.

I hate the way the system works. But always apply if you think you could do the job!

I have absolutely zero charisma. I don't really care what kind of work. I've done it all just about. I prefer to be outside, but that's a preference.

It’s been 4 months. After applying for any and all jobs I would remotely qualify for, I’m done.

Contract jobs, retail jobs, full-time/part-time jobs, temporary jobs, you name it, I’ve applied and yet here I am, still awaiting the utter privilege of employment.

Connecting with recruiters and applying on job boards leads to nowhere.

I need and deserve a break from the madness, stress, and seemingly unending disappointment that this job market so disturbingly brings.

What’s next for me? I don’t know but I hope it will come soon.

Decades ago, when you started a new job, you would be trained. You also likely had a mentor assigned to you. The company devoted time and resources to your success, as it would help them succeed.

But today, nobody trains anymore. There’s no investment. It’s not only sink or swim, it’s every man for himself. Nobody wants to help you (coworkers, managers) because helping you gives you a leg up, and they want that for themselves.

It’s disheartening to see how dystopian the whole scene has become.

i work in a small fast food restaurant that just recently opened and it’s my first job. whenever i’m working and my manager (35 yr old dude) has to explain something to me he always has to touch me. like i’m serving someone he will wrap his arm around me, he will grab me and move me around and when theres the other staff he will tap me and use me as an example for scenarios and basically touch me whenever he can. he also made a comment after posting a photo of me on their social media (i am the only staff member that has been photographed, and you can see the photo in one of my other posts) where he said “my friends always ask me who is the pretty girl from instagram and when is she working and i have to tell them ur only 16” like why would u tell me thisss, i appreciate the compliment but it’s weird 😭 he’s allowed to touch me sometimes but it makes me a bit uncomfortable but i’m probably overthinking.

I've been trying over 8 months to find a job and have gotten alot of rejection emails. I've had one interview and that ended up being a joke.

I've started having anxiety and panic attacks when I try to sleep now about trying to get and job and money.

A few days ago I had a job interview at a company that I've always wanted to work for as a software engineer. This was my first job interview and I was very nervous.

There was a 3 hour long technical interview which I studied very hard for and long story short I apparently did really well even though I didn't think I did because despite answering most of the questions there were a few that I couldn't answer that I felt like I should've been able to.

When It was time for feedback I was ready to be ridiculed but I was surprised when the supervisors started praising me instead. They said I was one of the best candidates they had so far, called me smart and even said they didn't expect me to answer many of the questions. This went on for a while and I'm not sure if It's because of how much I wasn't expecting that or because I've never been told these things before but nevertheless I teared up as they were talking and they had to stop for a bit while I calmed down then continue with the feedback.

Worst part is there were like 4 other people from the department I was applying for in the room with us watching it all happen and even though we sort of laughed about It afterwards and continued, I still feel like I messed up big time. But I just couldn't hold my tears back.

I've always been the type to cry easily at the smallest things and they're probably not looking for overly sensitive people (they jokingly mentioned at the end that I should work on that) so I feel like I ruined my chances. And even if I didn't ruin them and they hired me, I feel too ashamed to go back there after what happened and be known as the person that cried during their interview...

I wonder if this is normal or if I'm making a bigger deal out of it than I should be? I should be hearing back from them in a week or less.

Update: I got the job! I'm adding this in case someone goes through something similar and sees this post in the future. Also, thank you everyone for the kind and wholesome comments, I can't express how relieved and happy they made me and I know they helped other people too. I have no words to express my gratitude for all the love and support I received when I posted this. Good luck on your career journeys!

I am very unhappy at my current job. I’m not stressed or burnt out, in fact it’s the opposite. I’m bored out of my mind, don’t like my coworkers, location isn’t great, etc. the one good thing though is I am paid very well.

I just received an offer for another company, which seems like a better fit for me in a lot of ways. Also the annual salary is about the same as what I am making now but because of how it is structured (twice annual bonuses), my monthly take home pay is significantly (20%) lower.

I could technically do it, but it would be tight. I’ve seen other people post here they work less hours or less stress, but since I’m not stressed, just bored, is it a bad idea?

Hey y'all, I've got a bit of a problem at my work place. I started this job with my cousin at 12.50 a few months ago, and just recently got promoted to manager. I don't even know what my wage is yet but was told 13.50 back when they first called and asked if I wanted to be manager.

So that was fine, I got my check and did the math and realized I didn't have a raise. No biggie I text my boss to try and get it sorted out and he says hes gotta call corporate to talk about it on Monday, and then he tells me that normally managers start out at 13$ but he's gonna try and get me 13.50$. That kinda pisses me off greatly because now I have a role I don't even know how much I'm making.

So I was venting a bit to my cousin and his friend who also works there, and come to find out that friend, who started a few weeks after me as the exact same role started out WITH 13.50 already. Not even a manager just the general starting role. This friend has no experience and is a few years younger so my brain is a lil blown right now about this.

I've googled how talking salary with coworkers is protected by law but I wanted to ask you guys how should I go about this. I'm thinking now I'm not gonna stay on for less than 14 (which is still less then what cousin is making as a manager)

Thoughts?

Edit: Forgot to mention that boss doesnt even know if I'll get compensated for my raise for the previous weeks, and if I do, likely won't even be till next check

Edit: Ok we call it manager but reddit calls it supervisor

8 hours work. One hour for lunch. Add one commuting hour in the morning and another one in the afternoon. Oops - don’t forget the shower and preparation hour in the morning. What is left for your life?! Once you get home, do you have the time and energy to do what you enjoy? Am I the only sufferer? I have around 5 months of experience only.

Why does everyone say they're hiring? The only fucking places that are hiring are Wendys and McDonald's. Any decent place that might pay a bit more than minimum wage is NOT hiring.

Most that say they are, are LYING. The same ads have been posted on indeed for over 3 months or more just rotting away. None of them reply or check applications and they have hundreds of applications sitting around.

Places that are active will immediately deny your application for an ENTRY level job. Like what do these places want? You want someone with a masters degree to pay them $14 an hour? Get the fuck out. Job searching right now is HELL. These companies are greedy as shit and so full of themselves.

In most of my jobs, there were always managers who just disrespect their employees and set unreasonable goals. Ofcourse colleagues gossiping very negative stuff behind their back and the usual nice treatment in the face and we have ofcourse the infamous "You have to fit our culture, you can't change it" argument that is used as an excuse for every single crappy thing.

This seems like a complaint post, but genuinely, I am seeking for the reason why this phenomenon often occurs.

My wife and I are expecting our first child this fall. We both work full time and will continue to do so after the baby is here. My wife makes about $65k a year but is working upwards of 70 hours a week (salary) and has to go into the office 3 - 4 days a week. She was just offered a new job for $60k with 4 days work from home and an average work week of 40 hours. This seems like a no brainer in my opinion to take the new job, even with it being $5k less a year. She however would ideally to go up in salary when taking a new position. I mentioned to her that this new position would be like a raise as between not working so many hours and driving less she could be saving upwards of 100 hours per month. With a baby on the way the new position seems like the way to go.

When looking for new positions or for your current role how much do you value WFH and or a hybrid work option? Maybe my wife could find another position for say $70k but then has to go into the office everyday. Would you value the $60k position with 4 days a week more?

Thanks

Ok so I can't believe I'm writing this. But I have to take a medication that makes me go #2 very frequently. Each time is super quick and easy. Like very quick. And not messy. I know, TMI, but maybe relevant.

The women in my office are frequently complaining about the smell of the bathroom. Now, I'm 90% certain its not me. I know I would be a likely candidate because of frequency, but the most likely candidate is the reason we get emails from admin about being clean in the bathrooms. Apparently, someone in our office has been literally getting their poop on the walls and floors. Its a mystery. I've never personally seen it, but I also go in the same stall every time, so my guess is its just not happening in that stall. (Also, since this came out I actually started checking everywhere before I leave in case its some freak thing I don't realize I'm doing. Idk. Buts its not me.)

Anyway, a big conversation has started in the office about how rude it is to go #2 there (even if you aren't somehow getting crap on the walls and floor). A lot people say they go to the building lobby, or some say they actually go to a gas station or even home. I knew that sometimes some people did that, but assumed it was because it was a them problem not being able to go here. I didn't think it was because of poop etiquette.

I'm assuming these people only go once a workday. Maybe not a big deal to leave then. But it doesn't seem feasible to me since I go frequently. And regardless, is it actually rude?? Someone even told me they are personally offended by people going #2 in the office bathroom.
Basically title says. I interviewed with this company, went through 2 interview processes. I was sent a job offer 30 minutes after the 2nd interview. I’m ecstatic as it is a 40% pay increase of my current job. I accept, give my two weeks notice to my current employer and what not. I completed the onboarding HR sent me and signed everything last week. Two days ago, which would make a week exactly since I signed the offer letter, I get an email saying they would not be able to move forward with my offer due to “internal changes they had to remove the open position, but will keep my resume on file.” I am at a loss for words because I JUST put my two weeks in. I begged my boss to try and keep me at my current employer but she told me HR could do nothing about it. So here I am, without a fucking stable job because this company screwed me over. I gave them a negative Glassdoor review about my experience and how the company left me jobless. I get an email this morning from the company asking me to take down the negative review as it hurts their reputation. I don’t feel bad at all for what I’ve done since this company has left me without a fucking job.

Edit: Wow, I really didn't think my post would get this much traction lol. Thank you all so much for your comments, I was honestly feeling a little scared since I've never been in a situation like this before. The reassurance from the comments definitely helped me. I will get in contact with an employment lawyer and see where it goes from there. :) Thank you all so much again! <3

Edit 2: For people asking me to name and shame, while I really do want to, I’m not sure how much legal trouble I could get in. Company could sue me for “defamation” for all I know, even though I have proof of everything. I am just trying to be cautious and hope this doesn’t damage my future career.

Edit 3: Hi all, I’ve taken the steps and contacted employment lawyers in the NYC area. A good handful of them told me I did not have a case despite the evidence I gave them. I’m waiting to hear back from one more as this lawyer told me they will take a look at it but to not get my hopes up as promissory estoppel is up there with difficult cases to win. Fingers crossed! I will still continue job hunting in the meantime along with finding more employment lawyers that will take my case.

I was talking to one of my older co-workers, and he was asking why I work two jobs, I told him because my rent is $1800. He was like well damn you must live in a mansion, I said no just an 800 sqft apartment. He didnt believe me at all, so I showed him on my phone what all the apartments are going for in our town, and he was like wtf my mortgage is half that on a 4br house. He showed me pics of his house and it was huge and pretty decent, I looked it up on zillow and its worth $400 000. He bought it decades ago when it was around $100k.

Me and all my coworkers talk about the housing crisis a lot, and all the older guys who have been working there for 20-30 years all said they bought houses in their early 20s thanks to this job. I have the same job they did, the exact same position, and I will never be able to afford even a starter home. The American dream is dead.

Somebody older I know asked me why young people are "quiet quitting" their jobs and not trying to work hard. I told them that quiet quitting is a bullshit term that describes doing what was outlined in your contract, and not more. He started to tell me how you need to hustle and do more than the minimum if you want to succeed. I told him that the difference compared to many years ago is that now hard work is not met with commensurate rewards or opportunities. Then I asked him the following question:

If it is culturally acceptable to push people to go above and beyond what is outlined in their contract, why does the company always only pays what was agreed upon? Why doesn't payroll ever go above and beyond what was agreed? Shouldn't it also be culturally acceptable to expect extra salary in this case? Aren't my company quiet paying me?

He had nothing to say and just looked uncomfortable. He didn't really agree but he has no good answer either.

I worked at a small hospital in a rural area... worked my way up from entry level to upper management over the past 26+ years. I read the posts here, but I thought my situation was different. I thought I was different. I was running multiple projects and supervised several clinical departments effectively (at least that's what I thought).

We had a new CEO come in about a year ago and I was the only member of the admin team that he didn't pick himself, yet I still thought my situation was different and I was safe. Today, in a mere 45 seconds, he told me I wasn't working out and he was making a change to the leadership team. After 26 years, my career ended in 45 seconds.

So I sit here tonight admitting that I was stupid and naïve. I never thought it would happen to me, but it did. If you think it won't happen to you, don't be too sure.

Guy in mid-50's looking for a job... It happened a couple hours ago and I feel completely numb. I have chills. Not sure what to do or where to turn. Sorry to be a downer but I'm alone and needed to vent to someone. Thanks for listening. I'm going to bed.

Edit for a question - I had my work email on my iphone (via exchange server). I figured out how to drag the email messages to a gmail folder on my phone (to save some email addresses), but is there a way to save my contacts out of exchange before I delete the account? I don't care about the coworker email addresses, rather other (outside) contacts that I may need. There was only a month's worth of emails on the phone. If there's no easy way, then I guess I can always do it manually but I figured I'd see if there was an easier way first. Thanks to anyone who can help.

I realize that stop is written as "stopping" and keep is shown as "keeps". I haven't figured out how to fix that.

I'm not a mod and realize that many mods are disliked. That doesn't change the fact that they are performing work for free.

Just because someone "volunteered" to be a mod doesn't mean that they aren't working for free. You volunteer for a non-profit, community organization, to coach a kids' baseball team. It's not volunteering when you perform a task for the benefit of a for-profit company, it's providing free labor.

Reddit was valued at $3B in 2019 when Chinese company Tencent invested $150M. The majority owner of Reddit is Advance Publications https://www.advance.com/ which owns Conde Nast and many other companies.

People don't realize their own value to companies and let themselves get used and taken advantage of and it shows in how they value their own time and work product. Based upon the comments, I'm not surprised that many people complain about being underpaid and undervalued.
I work as an engineer in product development. I have 25 years of experience doing this kind of thing, 8 of those are with my current employer.

They’re in a fairly rural area and as a result have a hard time finding people with experience that they can put into more senior roles like mine.

I work a lot with our customers and the products I manage represent about $200M in revenue. A large part of that business is due to the relationships Ive developed with our customers. They definitely have other options.

Anyway, I was 100% WFH all through Covid and through the experience, I came to a few realizations. Mainly that I hated the commute, an hour each way. I live in a small city and commute out to the boonies for work.

So, when we started going back to the office, I wasn’t really happy about it, but in my case, it was only 1 day/week, and that’s probably reasonable for my job. Then it was 3 days in office but only if you filled out a form and justified it. A couple of months ago, they announced that we were all going back to full RTO, 5 days/week. I tried to protest, but despite data to the contrary my boss, his boss and on up the chain firmly believe the “We’re more productive IN the office!” BS.

They’re having a hard time hiring. Candidates will ask in the phone screen, “Is this position remote or hybrid?” and as soon as they hear, “No, we’re in the office 5days/week.”, 90% of the candidates will say, “I’m not interested then.” Needless to say, this means there are a lot of open positions.

Retention is declining slowly, but it’s mostly among people with just a couple of YOE and it’s easier to spread the workload around to the other employees doing the same work.

I’ve tried giving feedback to management that I was not happy with RTO, but they were not listening. So about 2-3 months ago I started looking elsewhere, just casually at first, but almost immediately, I started getting interviews and then an offer at a company that is about 10 minutes away. Much better pay, better benefits, more vacation and best of all there’s pretty much a “Come in to the office if you need/want to otherwise WFH.” They’re also paying for a nice sit/stand desk and a chair to use at home. Offer accepted!

I type up my notice letter, print 3 copies. It’s just the basic three sentences. (Thank you for the opportunities, It’s time to move on and this date will be my last day) One copy for my boss, one for his boss and one for HR. The HR copy I drop in their mailbox and the other two, I leave in their respective offices on their keyboards. Then I go about my day.

The next morning, I’m greeted by my boss and his boss both of whom are wearing a scowling version of the surprised Pikachu face. They ask me why. I tell them I haven’t been happy for a while and if they have to ask, they haven’t been paying attention.

They make a counteroffer, I decline. They make a better one, I decline again. They ask me what they can do to get me to stay. Finally, I tell them that there’s nothing to be done about it at this point, the time to act was all of those times I asked to WFH whenever possible and was denied. Repeatedly. They weren’t happy about the breakup, but they made their bed, let them lie in it.

During my transition, I tried to wrap things up as best I could and lay out the immediate needs for each project and I informed my customers.

I don’t know exactly what the fallout from my departure was, but one of my former colleagues did tell me that it’s been a complete shitshow.

Me? I go into the office once or twice a week and if the weather is nice, I’ll walk.

ETA: I do think there is value in some in office time, especially when it comes to new graduate engineers learning from old timers like me.

Well there’s actually some context but that’s the gist.

Long story short, I work for a very large company. Several thousand employees all across the country. I was 100% in office for years, including any OT. Then in March 2020 they told us to stop coming into the office… and work went on. Everybody got their jobs done from home.

Then RTO happened in March 2022, three days a week. Then they went to 4 days a week a few months ago. It sucked. I have a nice home office. My chair is more comfortable. I have windows and sunlight. My monitors are much bigger. I can have music or videos in the background, and I am soooo much more productive at home. But I only worked from home one day a week, plus OT. So in total, up to 30 hours a week from home, and 32 hours in office. Not bad.

But sometime in December I started to get headaches on days I was in the office. They really started to affect my work performance. I didn’t realize how bad it got until I went on vacation for 2 weeks and felt better. It was like waking up from a dream. So when I got back, I went to the doctor and asked them to write me out. They did for two weeks.

It took a few days for my headache to go away. And then I was free. But here’s the crazy part. I sent the medical accommodation to HR, and they said they’ll review and approve it. And they just never got back to me! I followed up daily until they said they have a committee that meets once a week to approve these requests. And I guess they just haven’t been meeting? When my two weeks were up, I got another note for a month. Submitted that one and again, zero movement. My plan is to get them for three months at a time going forward.

So officially, I am cleared to WFH until the committee approves me working from home. Bureaucracy at its finest! So technically, I am not approved to WFH, but I gave my management an excuse and stopped showing up. Nobody is questioning it. Honestly I could have made something up and nobody would care. I just got lost in the cracks. Wild.

The affects of being back at home are massive. I’ve lost about 15 pounds this month. I’m eating better, I have time to take long walks. My relationship with my wife improved. I get to play with the kids. I’m sleeping much better as well, and without meds! Almost no snoring which makes my wife happy. And most importantly, I haven’t had a headache in almost a month. A feel like a new man.

Early 2021 my company (4000 employees) closed all regional offices around the country. Kept open only a small amount of office space at HQ.

They started paying for our home internet. And also gave every employee a small stipend to spruce up their home office.

At the time the CEO and COO said this was permanent and would stay this way “forever.”

Fast forward 2.5 years and, guess what? They didn’t lie.

Every employee is permanently full-time remote. There’s no RTO chatter because there are no offices to return to.

Departments and teams do have semi regular offsite meetings and events for which teammates are invited to travel. But at least in my department leadership insists that it’s totally optional. Which makes these events way more fun and rewarding because they’re not compulsory.

We have teammates all over the country. A huge talent pool to draw from.

Reading all these RTO horror stories, I’m so grateful to have found a WFH company fully committed to the cause.

EDIT:

Since I’m getting DMs — The company is HealthEquity. And we’re always hiring so check it out!

So thankful that I can WFH. I used to wake at 5:00 AM for my commute and get home about 6:00 PM

Now I get to work by logging in at 7:00 AM and kick off at 4:30 PM. This lets me wake up about 2 hours later, which is such a health benefit. But, also, I get the kids up and going from 7:00 to 8:00. When they get home, I'm there to help them when they need it.

Has my work suffered? Not according to my promotion. Has my social life suffered? No, I'm talking more to my neighbors, so it's grown.

I'm polluting less by driving less, but also by eating less (I ate a lot more when I got up earlier).

My pets get more of the attention they need. The cat's let in and out when they please instead of using a litter box and the dog gets a noon-time walk instead waiting until she's fit to burst when the kids get home from school.

So there it is: I make more, do more, and am better at all the things.

I was approached for a role recently and they asked me about how I feel about going into the office. I was clear that I want to work from home and going into the office is of no interest to me.

When we then spoke about compensation I was very straight with them. If you want me in the office, you’ll need to pay me $20k a year just for the lifestyle change. (They already pay for public transport as an employee benefit)

Surprisingly they said that’s fine for the 3 says a week hybrid working and they’ve since schedule me for the final round of interviews.

For the record, I asked for a bit over their compensation range on the job description just to work from home, so I was taken back when they were okay to pay so much more to work in the office. That’s a bad deal for them. Great for me.

I'm in the office, stuck in back-to-back meetings and need to poop. The agony is actually kinda funny

Some interesting WFH stats here:

33% of remote working parents estimate saving $51-100 per week

58% of working mothers were remote in 2021 compared to 51% of fathers per Pew Research Center

54% say remote work allows more family time

Am I taking crazy pills? There is obviously a long list of reasons RTO is terrible for employees (time, energy, expenses, etc.). But I feel like it’s being completely missed that I’ve saved burning hundreds of gallons of gas by not commuting over the last couple years.

How are the environmental benefits being completely overlooked at the same time scientists are telling us we need to make DRASTIC changes to the way we live in order to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change?

RTO was announced a few weeks ago at the company I work for (after 3 years of record profits while we WFH). After initially feeling so disheartened, I took an interview for a 100% remote position at another company. I got an offer the next day and told my current boss I was leaving. He then told me he got an ‘exemption’ for me to keep working from home. So I turned down the new job.

Fast forward to this week and apparently our C-suite has denied my exemption (that I was told was guaranteed). So I’m putting in my two weeks. I’m going to miss this company I’ve worked with for 6 years and all of my coworkers, but this yo-yo-ing is too much. I’m going to take my savings and study for a few months before looking for a new remote gig.

Anyways, I wanted to thank this subreddit for all the camaraderie and the validation that we do great work from home. It helped me make my decision to quit. The cubicle life is behind us and wfh is the future.

No. We don't know of a part time WFH job that pays $100 an hour and doesn't require much work. No. We don't know of a WFH job because you think you can do it and also care for your infant/senile parent/dog. No. We don't know of a WFH job that will let you work 37 other jobs.

New York Times tech workers walking out over RTO today!

ETA More context here from Bloomberg:

“Workers have been in contract talks with Times management for 15 months, and said the company has been dragging its feet in negotiations while trying to curb their ability to work from home. US National Labor Relations Board prosecutors have concluded that the company violated federal law by unilaterally implementing a return-to-office plan and failing to negotiate with the union over it, according to Kayla Blado, a spokesperson for the board.”

The dumpster fire that is the Republican party in the House of Representatives has now set its sights on the plague that is WFH.

"If Republicans are able to pass their FSGG bill, it would require federal employees to work in the office at least as much as they did before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Instead of ‘leading by example’ in the construction of sustainable buildings, [the General Services Administration] should lead by example by bringing their employees back to the office, like the private sector,” Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., the bill’s author, said on the House floor on Wednesday. “We must hold the federal workforce accountable for the quality of their work and the service they provide to the American people.”

Do you enjoy it? How stressful is your job?

How many hours of work do you actually have to put in each week?

One of the hardest things for me with having to be on-site 3 days a week (hybrid after the covid lockdowns, used to be 5 days on-site) is not only the distractions of coworkers and forced socialization but knowing that they aren’t really my friends.

There are many TV shows where the people who work together all hang out together and are all best friends. The coworkers are all at your wedding and are even involved in your wedding party.

Where I work (and probably in most non fictional offices) it feels so fake. Coming in Monday morning…”how was your weekend?” Blah blah blah. On Thursday we start talking about what we’re going to do over the weekend. And it’s just chit chat for hours of my time with people that don’t genuinely care about me.

How many of them have I seen even once outside of work? (I live in a major city) How many of them have taken the extra minute to send me a “good luck” or “safe travels” or anything kind of text message? How many of them did I invite to my wedding or would have invited me to theirs?

Everyone was so interested in my pregnancy last year. How many people reached out during my maternity leave?

It’s just so empty to be spending so many hours with these people and be fake friends. I don’t know if I want to clam up or just continue it as I search for a different job.

Edit: I moved across the country for the job, so definitely wish it felt more sincere. It’s hard making friends and then of course covid hit when I was new to the area.

Edit2: I have made a repeated effort and eventually gave up. I was the one sending Happy Birthday messages and asking if people were okay Etc. That was me. I was the one offering to help etc. People in this workplace I’m in don’t want that.

It’s not all doom and gloom in the press

https://time.com/6294640/remote-work-winning/

think about it.

the waking up too early to shower and get ready, dress up in clothes you dont like, to drive 30m-1hr to a god forsaken mosh pit everyone hates with no privacy or peace, disgusting bathrooms, smells, other people's constant stupidity, managers on your throat.

oh god, those stupid office events, like potluck and shit. omg!

actually having to stay there for 8+ hours pretending youre working. LOL... never again.

I will only be looking at remote positions or positions that require you in office once a week. but definitely fully remote comes first, even if it pays less.

thinking about going to an office makes me CRINGE bros, CRINGE.

just go on youtube to watch one of those "dAy iN tHe lIfE oF a SoFtWaRe EnGiNeEr" and it's an instant ABSOLUTE NO

Being fully remote has its downside no one ever speaks about!

Prior to Covid I purchased a new car, that car is now sitting in a garage depreciating in value while I continue to make expensive car payments and insurance!

That’s just the start. I used to goto bed early so I could do my morning routine and commute into work. Without that, I now stay up later watching Netflix and I’m starting to run out of shows so I’ve turned to YouTube. YouTube is full of ads and I’m a sucker for a good ad so all the money saved being remote plus some is going into products the ads influence me to buy!

Now I’m starting to run out of space in my house with all the objects I’m buying so I have to buy a bigger house in this high interest rate environment!

I’ve also been eating healthier and going to the gym more. My doctor now says my life expectancy has increased by 10 years! Now that’s going to push out my retirement date as I have to save even more!

And don’t even get me started on winter. I now have to heat my house the entire day! My electric bill is through the roof! I miss my employer being the one to provide heating.

This is all so frustrating, I don’t understand why anyone would work remotely.

End rant!

Edit: before I loose all my precious Karma points I worked so hard to earn during work hours, this was pure sarcasm! Apparently I’m suppose to add an /s somewhere in here to indicate that…

i recently got a new WFH job and it seems like almost everyone has something negative to say about it. people will say things like “i would never want to work from home” or “they couldn’t pay me enough money to work from home again” but I’m over here like uhhhhh i think it’s amazing…i feel silly feeling that way, because everyone disagrees…does anyone else love working from home?

i get to be home with my dogs all day, and i get to pee whenever i want when I’m not in meetings, i can snack, i can save money on gas, I’m thinking it’ll be great for when i start a family, like idk????? i think it’s amazing, what does everyone think?

I noticed all the people pushing RTO are also the individuals that tend to stay late, work weekends, and yet don't get any more done/hours billed than anyone else. Something tells me that they just want to be at the office...and want everyone else there to keep them company because they hate their home life.

I work in IT for a giant corporation, and I have for quite a number of years. My work has me connecting to systems across the US and in major cities around the world every day. My team is geographically dispersed and I have never met any of them face to face. My boss lives in another state, joining a long series of managers I have had that I have never met. His boss lives in a third state.

My company also used to have a very good WFH program, that I was part of for several years. I never had any issues at all with productivity or attendance. That program got shuttered a few years before Covid hit, so I worked from the office in the afternoons a few days a week, and still did the bulk of my work from home. When the lockdowns hit in March of 2020, I was still mostly WFH, so it was an easy transition for me to WFH full time again. I just kept on keeping on, and still had no performance issues.

But now we're being told we have to return to the office 2-3 days a week. And, not surprisingly, I keep getting notifications that someone in the building has tested positive for the coronavirus. So I've decided I'm not going to go, at least not really.

They track how often we enter the building by scanning badges at the door, so I will scan my badge to get my ID in the log, and then I will turn around an go straight home again. I live close enough to the office that I can do this on my lunch break without any issue. I'm just going to continue WFH, and only nominally enter the building. My boss and his boss have both endorsed this behavior, but the drive for RTO is coming from far above their level.

It makes no difference to my actual job tasks, to any of my coworkers, or to my bosses where I sit when I do my job. It's beyond ridiculous that I should be asked to sit in one chair or another to do my job.

WFH should not be celebrated as an opportunity to sneak by doing less work. I think this sub would better serve the WFH community by helping people navigate how to work productively from home and take advantage of the inherent flexibility, but not in a way that will understandably be regarded as lazy by employers. Go to antiwork or similar for that.

I guess, what’s this sub about? I’d hope not a water cooler to talk about doing the bare minimum or a job board where people can put low effort “Looking for a WFH role” posts with no added context.

Sorry, end rant. Some posts on here are value add but you have to sift through a lot of garbage that doesn’t help the WFH community.

Great. Your baby is cute, congrats. I just want to get work done so I can log out on time for the day. Your kid is making a lot of noise and your attention keeps getting diverted. I dont want to see you playing with your kid while I am asking you questions on a 1 hour Teams call so I can get the document I am working on updated in time. The fuck? Maybe if its a one off thing, fine. But everytime?

Wfh isnt daycare.

Because the client needed everything to be in person and he explained we are all remote now. We have an expensive office in SF that he is subletting. This is no young hip company - it’s a tax law firm around for 30 plus years and my boss, the founder, will never ever go back to the office. Just wanted to spread some cheer to the doom and gloom.

I've been with my current employer, a large HCM company, for over ten years. Didn't WFH till COVID but quickly realized I did not want to go back. Employer is now forcing everyone within a certain distance back to the office 3 days a week and will be monitoring badge swipes to ensure adherence. On top of that, they want us there the same three days every week and have made it very clear that we should be in office all day.

They are also making all employees who were WFH prior to COVID and all those hired as WFH during COVID to adhere to the new policy as well. Oh, and bring your equipment back in and if you want monitors for home, you better buy those yourself.

The cherry on top is that they're referring to this extremely restrictive policy as "flexible work options."

So, thanks to this "flexible policy," I've now landed a FT WFH gig at a new company that'll be paying me 35% more. I may not be laden with morals and values but I refuse to let a company line its pockets and treat all its workers like dogshit.

TLDR; company said RTO, I said F that and got myself a nice big raise.

What a d-bag.

https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20231027198/white-house-opens-45-billion-in-federal-funds-to-developers-to-covert-offices-to-homes

Edit: Because apparently I need to say this for all the people whining about corruption and use of "their" tax dollars, this program is a combination of LOANS to developers/builders purchasing buildings to be converted to housing and also federally owned buildings that would be suitable to develop for housing.

The 6th largest company in the world and likely one of the most profitable in the world is proudly WFH. They have a huge HQ in Santa Clara, they don't seem to be letting their real estate investments drive their employee policies. Suck it, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft (and all the others).

I work for a media and advertising company with rather large clients and huge campaigns. Thankfully everyone can work from home and there is no plan to return to office!

The other week I was visiting my parents for a long weekend and would work from their guest room for one day. They have been retired for a few years but owned their own in-person business when they did work. They had an office and at one point 10 employees. Growing up, sometimes one of them would work from home and since they were the boss they still had some autonomy over their schedule.

When I was taking meetings or in a flow they still would walk in and interrupt the meetings or my flow periodically throughout the day. Some meetings were with the clients which through me off when interrupted.
I explained to them numerous times to please not interrupt me while I am working. I tried to communicate that it should be like I am in an office and on a schedule as they did when they had to go into their business. However, the only viewpoint they have is from their own business. In their mind, if I am home, I should feel like I am at home.

So does anyone else have family members that does not understand that work from home is still "at work."

Remote jobs aren't disappearing — they're just moving out of expensive coastal metros like New York and San Francisco.

Faced with labor shortages and rising wages, companies are hiring for more remote jobs overseas and in smaller U.S. cities.

During the pandemic, thanks to jobs that were no longer tied to offices, millions of Americans flocked to cities like Phoenix, Asheville and Boise, seeking greener pastures and more affordable housing.

But remote work has opened up new opportunities for employers, too. Companies quickly discovered that their employees could still be productive from afar, often for a third of the cost, if they stretched their location requirements.

I don't work in a linear way. No matter how early I go to sleep at night, I struggle waking up "bright eyed and bushy tailed." When I was in college, I had a 4.0 but I was a major night owl. I never bought the idea that productivity was synonymous with waking up at a certain time. Net hours studying at the end of the week is net hours studying. When I entered the workforce, I had quite the rude awakening. All of a sudden, something I was doing 5 days out the week for 8 hours was making me so unbelievably uncomfortable. All the time. Waking up and jumping straight into a commute to work, ODing on caffeine everyday, and feeling completely spent at the end of it all. When I mentioned WFH at my last job, (it was hybrid) I was crucified. I was told that it's a privilege that I was attempting to take advantage of the hybrid structure. But I didn't understand why that was the belief, especially since I got more work done when I was home time and time again. Not only this, but I was much less productive in office because I really struggled with working while around other people. As a neurodivergent person, I felt so misunderstood when it came to justifying why I preferred to work at home vs in office. Fast forward and I finally have a fully remote job after a year of searching for one. My productivity is through the roof and I've never been so happy. I can flex my hours and build a schedule that works for me, and so my night owl nature is finally embraced rather than ridiculed. I know I do good work. I always have. My brain is just different and that's OK. I'm so glad I work in an environment that allows me to fit in the world the way I do without being punished for it.

I am interviewing for a position that pays $13,000 less than what I am making now. It is the exact same position but it’s 100% work from home. They said that their offer cannot go up at all as it’s what is left in the budget.

(They apparently have 401k match, really good benefits, decent vacation/sick, and end of year bonuses.)

I loathe my current company and that’s why I am looking for a new job. I had to stay for a year in order to fulfill my sign on contract and that has ended in the beginning of June. This would be the shortest time I’ve ever stayed at a company.

My current company is a 35 minute drive in and a 45 min drive home. I work from home two days a week.

My car is getting louder every day, I’ve just replaced the alternator and battery in October/December. So, I am in the market for a new car because of the travel I have to do for work, otherwise I would hold out until I can’t drive it to the grocery store.

I’m a bit stuck here because $13,000 is a really big amount!

Edit: Current is 118k and new would be 105k.

What would you do? Do you have any advice?

I love the privacy; if you’re having a bad day, grieving something, or are upset or just feeling down, you can openly express those emotions without anyone being nosy. You can look sad or cry at your desk without some annoying coworker being like “omg are you ok?” or being intrusive and asking what’s wrong. I don’t think it’s a bad thing to ask someone if they’re ok, but I really don’t miss those overly supportive coworkers who would pry or give you unsolicited advice. It’s so nice to not have to put on a mask and pretend to be ok when I’m not. I know lots of WFH jobs require talking on the phone or participating in meetings with your camera on, but at least we’re in the comfort of our own home and can step away if needed.

Is it not reasonable for me to identify as a person who just doesn’t jive well with commutes. I’m not the best driver nor is it something I feel like I can sustainably do 5 days a week for 40 minutes through bumper to bumper traffic. It’s dangerous. There’s literally a crash everyday.

It would be embarrassing losing your life on a gridlocked highway whatever because Linda wanted to get to her desk by 9:01 so now she’s driving like a maniac through gridlock traffic and boom you’re rear ended.

And finally we live in a world where it’s archaic. Sure there are people who need to be at a physical location but if were being honest with reality 60 percent of the cars don’t need to be on the road. Why am I entitled for not wanting to commute?

I’ve posted here before. Long story short: I was hired as a 100% remote employee and now 2 years later, company has done a bait and switch and mandated a 5 day a week in-office requirement.

I expressed how dissatisfied I was with it and was met with “oh well!” basically.

New offer is a SLIGHT pay cut (I’m highly compensated) but I don’t even care anymore. It’s 100% worth it.

Point of this post is to encourage you to keep trying for remote work and keep pushing back against RTO mandates. Quit your RTO job as soon as you find a remote opportunity. Make these companies lose their good talent and suffer.

I've been working for a company for over a year that is mandating two days a week in the office. I believe this is just a start and they will soon increase the number of mandated office days. Every time I've been in the office, I haven't really collaborated with anyone, and most people look tired and over the RTO bullshit.

I've had recruiters reach out to me for fully remote positions, or positions that only require 1 day a month in the office, and I believe the best people will end up leaving their current roles for these opportunities.

Companies also forget that a lot of us remote workers who were made remote after the pandemic, and didn't really have a choice. Now they make it seem like we're too privileged (Elon Musk) for wanting to work in peace. Not to mention work expectations have increased so much, you can't get any work done with all the distractions in the office.

Hello everyone! I finally decided to put my two weeks notice over a stupid forced return to office mandate. This decision was a political decision since one of the higher ups in the company that I work for is on the board of directors for Minneapolis Downtown and Frey is pushing since few months ago to get tech employees back to the office. I have to drive 70 miles roundtrip to the office Tuesday/Thursday for nonsense meetings. What a joke! I have been working from home before Covid hit (June 2019), there’s no way I will get back to waste my time/money on commute. Just wondering if anyone else is going thru the same. Peace/out 🙌✌️

This use to be a semi-regular occurrence in my life. Bad day at work, before work not wanting to go in, mid-day escape to the car at lunch and cry. The last time was Feb. 2020 when I had to go into work early and stay late, and realized if I sped home I could maybe have 15 minutes to hold my 1 year old before her bed time. Locked down a month later and never looked back. I think of this every time they mention returning to the office and “office culture.”

Pretty much like the title says, have you ever had an embarrassing moment while wfh? Mabye during a meeting you were accidentally unmuted or during a call something happened in the background or anything of the sort?? For me during a group meeting, of over 200 people, I was unknowingly unmuted and my spouse caught a mouse. I started yelling(thinking I was muted), "are you serious?!?! A mouse?!?! What do we do???? Are you sure it's a mouse?!?!" And when I looked at my screen people were laughing and posting gifs of Jerry from Tom and Jerry and other similar things. The person hosting the call had to say "let's all please make sure to be muted." It was beyond embarrassing 😳 wbu??

My company stupidly decided to force people back into the office twice a week.

That was probably the worst decision they have ever made. During the whole pandemic, the company hired hundreds of people all over the country as remote.

They said if you live near the office, you must come in twice a week.

As a manager, I also do not agree with this return to office BS.

My employees who do live near an office (I don't) expressed how it's not helping with anything. there is basically 0 collaboration because the people my team interacts with is scattered all over the country.

I told them I'm not going to take attendance like this is fucking kindergarten. No idea how this is going to go but as their manager, this is something that does not impact our work.

everything we do is managed/tracked in tracking tools online, like our projects so as a manager, I always know what people are working on, what they have to work on, etc.

any other managers out there doing the same?

Or just let us do the same thing from home

The commute is key. I swear every person who says they love being ‘in person’ has like a 5 minute walk to work. I don’t want to have to spend 50% of my income on rent to have a reasonable commute.

now everyone loves downtown coffee and collaboration and shit

RTO (return to office) is just the new way of trimming the workforce without having to fire people. Here is how it works:

Company mandates RTO, the more days per week, the more people they want gone

Employees decide they'd rather not RTO, so they quit

Employer doesn't have to lay off any, or as many people, due to the quitters.

Sure, some people have avoided the RTO mandates for now. But if your employer is playing this ploy, those who ignore the mandate will be fired.

The employer can change your work arrangement at any time unless you have a union. That is how the game works, people. Even if you were hired "fully remote", they can change you to "in-office" at anytime.

It isn't personal, it is just a business flex.

I know we all have our various reasons for working from home. Yesterday I was reminded of why I work from home, even if I often miss going into the office.

While driving to work I was in the left lane of the freeway when it suddenly slowed. I hit my brakes and slowed down. The car behind me realized he wouldn’t be able to stop in time and tried to swerve out of the lane. He still hit me and sideswiped the vehicle in that lane right off the road. An hour later the state patrolman arrived, and 30 minutes later I made it to the office.

Overall it was just a minor accident, nobody was injured and I only suffered minor damage to my vehicle. In addition to arriving at the office 80 minutes later than I would have, I spent an hour filing a claim and talking to my insurance company and another 45 minutes filing a claim with his insurance company, plus we have to take the car to their office to get an estimate, and eventually after the claims go through we will lose access to our car for a few days while it gets repaired.

I was with a company for 10 years. We WFH during COVID and until mid-2023. It was like a massive stressful weight was lifted from my back. I could finally breathe and felt so much more balance in life. Overbearing management no longer controlled most of my waking hours. Also my efficiency sky rocketed, so a win/win.

I saw signs of RTO and jumped at a much better WFH opportunity. Now 3 months later, my previous company is requiring Tues-Thurs in office. I feel like I dodged a runaway truck on the highway of life. I’m bitter against them even though it doesn’t impact me. It amazes me how a company treats employees like children - no trust and constant control.

I suppose this is an appreciation post for WFH. I’ll never go back to an office.

Just wanted to add a positive experience to the sea of RTO misery. A couple of months ago my company demanded that everyone within 60 miles of an office RTO for at least 3 days per week. Since then, I’ve heard nothing on the subject. I continued to WFH and ignored the demand.

In our most recent company announcements, they backtracked and said that they won’t ask anything of anyone that “doesn’t make sense.” They spouted off about how happy everyone who did RTO is, and how great the offices are, but if you are more productive at home or most of your team isn’t located near your office, you won’t be made to return.

I think that enough people quit and/or threatened to quit that it forced the company to take a much softer stance on RTO. I guess the moral of the story is to hold firm, ignore RTO demands, and begin the search for a new job as soon as they sound the alarms. We will win this in the end but we have to hold the line.

Yes this is long and yes this is a throwaway. Why am I anon? As much as Paychex corporate is driving me insane, they still pay me money, and whaddya know, I need it.

Paychex is one of the corporations returning to office. They promised a ton of us WFH myself included upon hiring. Many of us have been for years. They announced RTO last week. Some people have posted about it here already

Today we had a “town hall” virtual meeting. Well over 400 people on attendance while high-ranking management tookcturns doing their quarterly reviews etc.

“We do know a lot of you have questions about recent happenings like the return to office/hybrid direction we’re headed. We will cover that in a bit.”

And they did eventually. However they skated past it to cover “other topics” that nobody really cared about. 440 people were there chiefly for one reason:!why are you taking away wfh?

they spent most of the meeeting covering figures, projections, the usual. We all knew that they wouldn’t address RTO til the end. It’s textbook. Make people sit through boring garbage for an hour, they’ll be less fired up at the end when that topic comes up.

Theytold us that the company is making record strides, we’ve hit record numbers (and they are impressive), we’re kicking butt. We’ve literally hit all of our goals and then some in just about every possible way. We’re branching out here, there, creating new program here, testing this for clients here, you all are wonderful.

They are proud of us, and we should be proud of ourselves. They are very fortunate to be leading our multiple departments in exciting new endeavors.

You know, corporate stuff.

Then the moment arrives. Why no wfh? Supposedly some 3rd party company has “lot of detailed data and research” showing that the wfh has actually hurt productivity, especially with new hires. They assured us of course that this analysis was very thorough. People who get hired on will get where they need to be quicker in an office setting, knowledge and skill-wise.

K I can get behind that. In-person training honestly should be required for my department.

By the way this is well over an hour into the meeting they finally bring this up. This whole time people have been lighting up the meeting chat about the RTO order. No anonymity. nowhere to hide,’and they don’t care.

Corporate suits proceed to tell us that productivity will be boosted by RTO, that we’re actually not hitting certain internal metrics that we were achieving pre-pandemic when everyone was in office, that certain performance “trends” need to be corrected or balanced.

They then continued on to talk about some “new & exciting” training programs and onboarding new employees.

They just skated past the wfh topic and moved on.

Look I don’t think anyone thought anything would really be resolved at a company review meeting with hundreds of employees watching… but the chat blew up.

My personal favorite: “you just spent over an hour telling us how productivity is through the roof and the company’s figures have never been better, and now you’re telling us that because some new hires slacked off, we all have to pay the price?”

Someone called the pre/post pandemic citing “irrelevant” since it’s common knowledge that a very good chunk of Payhex employees were already wfh well before that.

Employees, supervisor, team lead, a 17 year veteran, someone who piloted some new program for the company, everyone was relentless and it was so satisfying. Someone said “so becausecnew hires can’t discipline themselves we, the tenured people who have boosted your company’s ‘amazing’ performance, have to pay the price?”

Someone chimed in demanding if performance was poor enough to bring us all back into office, how the heck are we putting up these amazing numbers?

Well I think a lot of us in this subreddit know that Companies that own buildings/commercial real estate aren’t getting what they paid for with tons of people gone. They want more oversight, more control. They want to lay people off but don’t want to pay unemployment, so they try to get people to quit.

One individual in the chat said “The 33 years I’ve been w Paychex, I have never felt this undervalued.”

And of course at the end we got the usual “thx so much for all your hard work, we’ll review the questions in the chat very soon, etc.”

On one hand, I understand that the people on that call couldn’t/didn’t want to start answering those heated comments because a) there were way too many b) the shots were being called by the suits above these suits, c) you can’t make an angry mob happy with answers that aren’t what the mob is looking for.

But the fact that they seriously spent over 60 minutes praising us for our hard work, elevating the company to new heights and profits, commended us for accomplishing so much while ao much expansion was going on, etc… only to then give us that piss poor excuse suddenly about “well, internally though, the numbers don’t lie and this and that metrics keep falling lower every year,” etc…

It’s not that I can’t work in an office. Trust me I’ve I done much worse. To work in an office is a privilege. That’s not th problem.

The problem is you promised me during my interview that Full time wfh during would be an option after 3 years w the company.

The even bigger problem is I am literal walking proof that my entire job and all of its responsibilities, both client facing and internal, can be done from my living room.

To any nay-sayers, I can do my job well too. My performance reviews agree. My productivity has actually skyrocketed compared to being in office.

Its the principle of it. Don’t til us numbers are down when they aren’t. Source? You, like 4 minutes ago. Don’t insult my/our intelligence.

You might be wondering how some anonvposter on Reddit thinks they’re so intelligent when they’ve madelike a hundred typos and mistakes in this posts.

Cause this is a throwaway and the dummber they think I am, the better. Also it s hardd to defeat autocorrect.

Paychex leadership: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. We’re killing it because you’ve given us great work/life balance. Do not ever underestimate the value of great work/life balance. For most of us, this is why we came, why we stayed, and why many are already packing.

EDIT: a bunch of people also voiced compensation for RTO. Some people live much further away, others have sold a car because they don’t need it, others will have to now fork out $ for expensive child daycare, etc. Which honestly corporate will probably shrug at, and I can’t necessarily blame them for that.

multiple people also outright asked “did you consider how many of us you’re going to lose with a decision like this?” (Spoiler: they certainly did. During our first RTO meeting last week we were told that “don’t worry the company took into account resulting attrition…” meaning yeah we know and we don’t care, we’ll just hire more.

Many if not most of us have seen the "daily lives of WFH" where they leave the house to run errands, take a nap, etc etc. I know some of it may be exaggerated but posting that is still irresponsible.

While some employees may have those luxuries, the vast majority of people who work from do not.

I'm sure managers and bosses have seen those TikToks or reels, so they would be included in the list of reasons to RTO. Reading the comments under those videos, you can see the jealousy/division of those who can't work from home, thinking we all are just relaxing and goofing of all day.

Idk why I'm posting, just a thought I had.

I had the dreaded call back to office back in February of this year, and I don’t even need to get into how absolutely miserable it has been. BUT…..thanks to a friend in HR, I discovered a way to get back to remote without having to leave my job. What’s the answer you might ask? ADHD

I was diagnosed with ADHD in high school, and have been medicated ever since. I truly struggle as an adult/professional due to this disorder. I’ve always thought of it as something I’m working against, but never really thought how it could work for me. Well, in talking with my HR pal, he informed me that ADHD is a protected disability under the ADA! Something I never even considered apply to me.

At my next doctors appointment, I will be asking for a WFH accommodation. A company like mine would be crazy to try and fight that, plus it is retaliation if they fire me. Sounds foolproof to me, but let me know if I’m not thinking of anything. My next doc appointment is 8/10

Update: Lots of opinions here and I appreciate most of them. I see that “loophole” was not the best word to use here. I will take your input and do more research before I take any action. Thanks Reddit!

I laugh at all the rush of articles in the news condemning remote work from all these huge overpaid CEOS or wardens 🤣🤣🤣 I would literally rather swallow glass than EVER return to an office.

They really think we don't know it's because they are losing precious money in their stupid corporate ghost buildings. Bohhhooo, get over it and evolve! We are not your slaves.

We are not going back EVER

"Work from home" sounds like something invented by the RTO crowd to make it sound like we're all just chillin in our jammies on the couch. I can easily understand why some people wouldn't want to work at home all the time and are averse to the concept of "WFH." But it's nonsense. Remote work can still mean working in an office. it doesn't mean "work from home." it means "work wherever the heck you want as long as you can still do your job."

Realizing that if the task can be done on the computer than it can be done from just about anywhere on the planet is something managers and property investors are desperate for people to not grasp and making "wfh" the colloquial term serves that purpose. I've been working remotely for 15 years. sometimes I rent an office, sometimes i work at the beach. "work from home" is intentionally reductionist and intentionally uninspiring. i would ditch the phrase entirely.

I currently make 45k fully remote (I do have a partner that also makes 45k so we’re doing fine and live within our means). My current job isn’t bad and it’s allowed me a lot of freedom, specifically being able to travel to see family and still work. But… it doesn’t necessarily pay well so I’ve always been looking for something that pays more.

Well, I got offered an in person job at 95k and was going to take it, but I decided after the older of my two dogs unexpectedly died this week that the time I get to spend with my loved ones because of remote work was more valuable than 50k.

Now here I am at 1pm, done with all my work, and I’m going to play fetch with my younger dog. And that to me is worth more than the extra money.

They did a poll on if you would leave considering this news and over 80% said they are going to leave.

So this is a bit of a rant, really. I started a new job in August 2021 that was fully remote at that point due to COVID, with the idea that we’d move to a hybrid model in time. After 8 months, we moved to two days a week on-site. This was great for about another 8-9 months.

At that point my partner and I were starting to talk about moving in together. He owns his place, I rented, so it made sense to move into his place. I’d been renting an apartment a five minute drive from my office; his place is a 35 min to 45 min drive, but I figured I could deal with it twice a week.

In February, we were told we needed to start coming in 4x a week because reasons. (There is zero business case that anyone has been able to convey. It appears the real reason is - surprise, surprise - to justify commercial office space).

I’ve just finished moving in with my partner, and wow, did I underestimate how much a 45 minute drive to work SUCKS after having not done any meaningful commuting since Feb 2020. I get so much less sleep now that I have to deal with shower/hair/makeup/commute before getting my day started. In the evening, I’m so much more exhausted after work.

I’m an individual contributor, so by design I need to ignore other people in order to do my work. My work doesn’t lend itself to “collaboration”. The only “collaborating” that happens is my small team sitting around venting to each other about how utterly pointless it is to be on-site.

On top of this, my company is doing renovations to our office space. I was told with just a few hours’ notice last month that I had to pack up everything and move to a new cubicle to make way for construction work. No one told IT, and my new cubicle wasn’t wired for Ethernet (and the wifi constantly drops). It’s been a month and still no Ethernet.

So I have to get up early, get all dolled up, pack a lunch, then spend 45 min in traffic – just to use the same laptop I could use at home, but also having to use my personal phone as a mobile hotspot when the wifi drops.

None of this makes any sense. How are companies/executives still justifying this? Sigh.

At my last firm (I was a partner) our business leased office space that was owned by just a few of the partners. Many years prior, we had all had a chance to invest in the commercial real estate that we would then lease to the Firm. Eventually, the lease payments from the Firm would pay off the mortgage and the individual partners who owned the building would have a nice nest egg. I decided not to invest in the building for many reasons andI’m glad. When I retired from the Firm and started my own firm in my home office, I had no further ties to them.

‘Fast forward to the pandemic. Suddenly everyone realized that we didn’t need all that expensive office space. At the Firm, some of the partners wanted to go fully remote and no longer lease that office space. But the partners that owned the building realized they NEEDED the space to be filled so the mortgage could be paid. And the building was not sellable at that point because suddenly the value of commercial real estate plummeted. Well, the partners who were also the building owners were in the majority and mandated RTO. A question for all of you: how much of RTO is driven by the owners of commercial Real estate that also own the businesses?? i’m new to this sub, so maybe this has been brought up before?

I love working from home, but I find myself with no reason to leave the house many days. When I worked in an office, all I wanted to do every day was sprint home and hide from the world, but now that I'm willing to do things after work, I'm finding there's not that much I actually want to do.

I have no kids, no dog, no partner (by choice for now), no local family, don't like just hanging out at bars/restaurants, mostly indoor hobbies, and treadmill/workout equipment in the basement. I'm currently saving money for a move, so I don't shop much. I meet up with friends occasionally, but that's usually on the weekends. Sometimes I'll think about doing something after work, and I can't think of a single thing to do beyond maybe go for a walk/hike but between the heat in the summer and darkness in the winter, that's not always an option.

I'm not looking for advice or anything because this isn't a problem. I actually feel pretty content, but I was wondering if any of you all feel the same and what do you do? Sometimes I wonder if my neighbors are like "there's that weirdo woman who never leaves her townhouse" lol.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies! It's nice to know I'm not alone feeling content just hanging out at home (which includes going into my yard and catching some rays--don't worry! lol)

Currently making about 130k and was offered a WFH job for 118k with 5% yearly raises. I enjoy my current job, however I have been there 10 years and could use a change. Also I currently drive 2 hrs every day for my current job and that is getting old. Benefits would be the same. Is the quality of life change worth a pay cut?

I have wfh in various jobs for 7 years. I love it and I can also meet up with friends who do it too

I have seen a lot of people complain about being at home all the time?

Since most people use laptops for wfh and can work from different places - why not go to one of those other places I listed in the title to work and be a bit social ?

(Excluding people on desktops and who are required to only work at their house)

https://archive.ph/t6Nmd#

I'm just wondering if it would be worth it for my peace of mind, work life balance, the chance to learn new things. I'm really not happy at my current position. The political climate at my current job is toxic, they're forcing us all back to the office 3x a week after 3 years of being fully remote. The job itself is repetitive and boring. We are all overworked. But the pay and the benefits are really good. I make about 96k. I don't think I could get that matched anywhere else. I am interviewing with a smaller company that is offering me 80k to be fully remote. I'm really tempted to take it. I am going to try to negotiate but I don't think there's that much wiggle room for them to go too much higher.

It's 3:30 in the afternoon, the kids are at camp this week, and both my wife & I WFH. We took the opportunity to get out of the house for a mid-afternoon date. A quick run to Target and then a cocktail & snack at the bar next store.

This flexibility is the biggest thing that I love about WFH.

I ain't going back.

Katie Porter CA 47.. now running for Feinstein’s open CA Senate seat is pondering a “national right to work from home legislation” with payroll tax cuts for employers. Let her know your support for the idea.

I’ve worked for my employer for 15 years, offered a WFH position two years ago and the micromanaging is driving me insane! If I take more than a 15 minute break, my computer shuts down…so if I’ve had my 15 min break and need to take an additional bathroom break, I’ll come back and my programs are closed. Sometimes this happens after being away from my desk for 10 minutes of my first break if the day. Screenshots are taken hourly…if not more, voice recordings, remote team viewer watching every move, if the mouse isn’t used on my main monitor for two minutes, a two minute warning box pops up although I’m actively working on my second monitor or reading through data to find what I need to complete a task. If I don’t click the ok/continue on the two minute box the computer shuts down (so I have to log back into 9-12 programs) to start back working. I was recently asked to clarify productivity on roughly 6-7 specific days since I was logged in, but nothing happening on my computer in terms of metrics…..I was actually attending mandatory assigned virtual classes and leadership classes, which are listed on my transcript with dates/times the classes were taken/completed. I fulfill my responsibilities at work and complete all of my tasks, while also helping my coworkers complete their assigned tasks. Are all WFH jobs this micromanaged because I’ve developed severe anxiety from the daily stress of constant monitoring and now thinking about a change? I feel like a prisoner in my own home or is this just the norm?

As a parent with a child in the school system, it’s absurd how little flexibility is given to parents for pickup and drop off times.

I can’t imagine having to “ask” to go pick up my child from school on half days or get warned for getting to work 10 minutes later if the morning school bus was late.

Why isn’t the USA family friendly? Why are we punishing parents for you know…. PARENTING?!

Luckily I WFH but I’ve seen some family members stress over late buses and such. Wtf.

Companies That Don't Mandate Office Attendance Grow Revenue Faster, Study Finds

November 14, 2023

Revenue at companies with flexible work-from-home policies grew four times faster than those with in-person requirements, according to a new study by Scoop Technologies and Boston Consulting Group.

The findings, from a survey that analyzed 556 public companies that employ a collective 26.5 million people across 20 sectors, represent a significant blow for proponents — and owners — of office space.

Firms that allow their employees to either work entirely from home or pick the days they come in increased sales 21% between 2020 and 2022, per the survey, first reported by Bloomberg. Companies with hybrid or full-time office policies saw revenue growth of just 5%.

Among the companies that do require office work, those that allowed just a few days in-person saw sales go up at twice the rate of those that demanded workers come into the office full-time.

“This starts to be a more compelling case for CFOs and CEOs to not be five days in the office,” Scoop co-founder and CEO Rob Sadow told Bloomberg. “People ask if revenue growth is the best proxy — you could also look at shareholder returns. There is no perfect answer, but we felt this was a first step in the right direction.”

The revenue growth in the survey was normalized against average industry growth rates, so the findings weren't skewed by higher-performing sectors.

One possible explanation is that flexible workplace policies allow companies to hire from a broader range of people, and to recruit more quickly.

At Allstate, for example, remote-friendly jobs receive double the number of applications, Fortune reported. A total of 84% of its new employees in the U.S. in the last year don’t live near a company office. The insurance giant slashed its real estate footprint by over 50% alongside its embrace of remote work.

The remote work debate has raged for years now, as workers, employers and office landlords have debated the best way to drive productivity. While office owners have stressed that in-office work is the best way to do business, employees have often balked at returning to their desks in the same way they did before the pandemic. Some sectors, like law firms, have taken a more hardline approach and mandated that their workers come back to the office.

Tech firms gave workers a lot of flexibility, but have in recent months brought workers back, with companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google mandating multiple office days per week this year. More than 3 million workers are expected to be under new office attendance mandates this year, according to JLL.

Those mandates have yet to result in a large bump in office occupancy, and office markets in places like New York continue to be affected by the rise of remote work. The availability rate in Manhattan, the country’s largest office market, was at 17.8% in October, according to Colliers.

I left my remote job earlier this year because I was pretty burnt out. The money was decent and I had the potential to grow my salary, but at that point, the money was not worth my mental health (I was almost hospitalized from burnout). I got a new job that is 5 days in the office and took a $10K paycut (which I thought would end up not making a difference, but it really does smh). I bought a car and of course, with the car came expenses for gas every week and a half, required maintenance and the dreaded insurance. At my job, there is also heavy pressure to go to happy hour and drink heavily, as well as spend money to participate in activities for "the office culture".

I realized immediately I made a huge mistake taking this in-office job. I know that I can start bringing lunches from home, say no to happy hours and activities, etc, but along with taking a paycut, I am losing so much money.

I am debating finding a remote job again so that I can save money and hopefully get a higher salary. I also hate going into the office. Is this a good idea? I would still have the car and its expenses, but I could potentially sell it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I couldn't do it, the open office was too distracting and I felt resentment towards leadership. I emailed HR and I'm getting a constructive dismissal. 1/3 of the company is leaving because of these tactics.

It probably won’t come as a surprise to anyone here that the media loves to publish anti-WFH on the regular.

Since the pandemic, I’ve seen articles arguing:

WFH is ruining the economy, killing cities

Workers are desperate to get back to the office (this was more prevalent during Covid itself; now they seem to be accepting employers are “forcing” people back)

WFH is for poor performers

WFH is due to a lack of commitment

WFH means you can’t onboard properly or bond in teams

WFH is bad for mental health

WFH ruins your chances of promotions, and in fact makes you more likely to lose your jobs

I’m probably not alone in guessing there’s a landlord-driven agenda behind all this. And that there’s an attempt to drive a wedge between people who WFH, those who work hybrid, and those who have to travel to work.

But it seems… unrelenting! It tends to come in waves or clusters of articles. And it doesn’t seem to be slowing down.

Is this just media noise or will it succeed in clawing back the gains in work/life balance, mental health, and job satisfaction we’ve seen since 2020? My current company likes to encourage us to come in every few months but it’s all voluntary, thank God. I just worry that if I get made redundant, I’ll have to go back to hybrid if the anti-WFH stuff takes off.

Q: I had a text only interview and they're asking me to buy equipment. Is this a scam?

A: Yes its a scam. Move on

2. Q: I have no direct prior experience for roles I'm applying for or am pivoting and changing careers, why can't I get interviews for WFH roles?

A: Companies hiring fully remote positions desire turnkey, plug and play new employees with direct similar experience or a lot of industry experience as most companies have not worked out developing and training fully remote employees. They want you to have demonstrated success within the role or industry they are in. Try to get a local in person role and apply for remote roles in a year or two.

I'm sorry, but I'm getting exhausted with reading those two posts over and over.

My hours entered are 2300 YTD.

My billable hours are 1900. Based on my rate they charge the client, they will bill 1 million $$ off my work.

People see lots of hours and think there is no way I had a life working this much. In reality it has been the easiest work year in my career.

I am a better employee as a remote worker than I ever was in the office.

I’ve given up fighting the camera requests, and usually don’t even mind any more. I think they have their place for certain smaller meetings. I do think mandating them 100% is stupid, and our company seems to have a hard on for seeing everyone all the time.

When you get more than like 8 people, it seems pointless. You can’t even see everyone at once if someone is sharing their screen, and then I just find myself people watching and scrolling through the pages of camera feeds, and become distracted.

Not sure if this weird or just goes to show how boring the meetings I’m on are.

Just an appreciation post.

Prior to working remotely it was so difficult to be home for repairs (plumbers, appliance repair, etc) and if they couldn’t show up it was a disaster and a whole day of PTO burned. My job was 45 minutes away (same for my spouse) and I couldn’t pop in and out or anything like that. It got to the point where I just kind of gave up and let a lot of things go and was so frustrating.

Now that I am remote it is so much less stressful. My house is in MUCH better shape in general.

I just had a guy tell me unfortunately he can’t come until tomorrow, and the fact that this doesn’t bother me at all is incredible. There is no rearranging of my schedule or lost PTO time to accommodate this.

Anyone else feel the same?

First week back in the office for 3 days and here’s how it went.

I caught the flu ( I haven’t been sick at all when remote)

My health went down the toilet. Adjusting to the schedule means I’m buying frozen meals, eating office chocolate, sitting all day/exhausted when I get home to workout or cook

I’m now sick so can’t enjoy my weekend plans

I hate my job, I actually like it when I’m remote

Coworker gossip and soaking up their energy. When I work at home I can limit exposure to people I really don’t want to be around

Having two 15 min breaks and 1 hour lunch spent running to my car to rush home to let my dog out or walking around building with coworkers . At least at home I could use this break time to cook or walk the dog

Ugh just seems like such an unnecessary way to make humans suffer. I would have been okay with one or two days ( granted still not great) but damn this week sucked.

Tried watching The Office for the first time since COVID lockdowns and while it's still pretty funny, I also realized just how much bullshit the characters wouldn't have to put up with if they were allowed to WFH. The premise of the show (at least in the early seasons) was always about how bleak and soul crushing office jobs are with toxic coworkers and idiot bosses under buzzing florescent lights. It becomes even more so if you imagine all these characters are there because of forced RTO.

Apparently we’re all going to look like freaks if we continue working from home. I guess it’s just more typical Daily Fail material.

Does anyone deal with friends or family who treat you like your job isn't real, or that you have unlimited free time during the workday?

For example, I had a single 15 minute break one day in between meetings (busy day), so I went outside to get away from the computer. My wife and another family member were outside, working on some project, and the aforementioned family member made a snide comment that I should be helping out. There were a couple other times where they were over and said similar things when I was taking breaks, but fortunately they haven't done this in a while.

Has anything similar happened to anyone else?

I’ve been remote now for just over two years. First job was working for government contracts. I didn’t love the job, and I was micromanaged but overall.. still blew the hell out of doing the same job from a cubicle.

Now I work in insurance sales, and while my income isn’t nearly as good as I’d like it.. I’ve done a lot worse. But working from home is just truly amazing.

I have virtually no stress for work. I have a very hands off boss and I’m very competent at what I do for only being a 1-year employee.

My job starts at 9. I usually wake up around 6, naturally. (Wife is a teacher so her alarm gets me up even if I don’t wake up first). I have 3 hours to do whatever I want. Lately it’s been studying for school.

It’s so nice knowing there’s no “getting ready”. No commute to prep for. No mental gymnastics of timing things out to make sure I’m not late. All my time just saying my own.

Oh shit it’s 8:59am and I’m downstairs? Walk upstairs, sign in, done. Complete control of the room. AC set at a temp that best works for me. Shirtless. Comfortable gaming chair. Feet up on the desk. Snacks at the ready. Everything I need to be as comfortable as needed. It does SO much for my motivation to succeed and do well, and it shows in my results.

I’ve never had a problem working in person, but now that I’ve worked from home I’ll have a very hard time not doing it.

Just got told we’re going to 3 days in office next week. Have been WFH since the start of the pandemic. But CEO wants everyone back 5 days a week, our executive compromised with 3. I’ve been told it’s based on real estate. But, they’ve said the words “more collaboration” and “work atmosphere”. I’ve started looking for new jobs already, that’s where they get ya. If you’re compensated well with good benefits, you feel stupid looking for another job. But the quality of life is so much better in wfh.

After 3 months of searching I landed a WFH job in my profession. No more having to go into an empty ass office twice a week where I don’t even see my boss 🙄

I’m so happy!

This is something I posted on LinkedIn that had a decent response. Figured you guys might enjoy it.

Does anyone know the real reason for the big push to get people back in the office or work in a hybrid model?

I know there is the often touted and ridiculous "idea generation and harming culture" reasons, but there has to be more to it than that. Ideas don't come from being forced together. They come from being free to let your mind wander and collaborating with people - neither requiring an office.

To me, forcing people to go into an office is like moving wild birds into cages. They've learned to fly freely, navigate, and socialise in the open environment, demonstrating their ability to function and even thrive without the cage's confines. Putting them in a cage doesn't improve their creativity, productivity or relationship with other birds. All you're doing in that instance is stifling their newfound creativity and adaptability.

If your company culture requires people to be in a cage, it might indicate that the culture is based on control and confinement rather than trust and empowerment. If that's the case, I'd argue that your culture isn't worth saving.

The software developers have turned remote at the USPS. The remote work is a condition of employment secured by union contract. These jobs are fully remote and you can live anywhere in the US. Best of all, they are union positions with a no layoff clause in the union contract. To apply go to https://www.usps.com/careers and search for computer.

Most developers at the USPS have a bachelors of science in computer science. I expect there will be a lot more competition for these jobs now that they are officially remote.

I’ve worked at the USPS for 25 yrs as a software developer. If you have any questions, feel free to message me. I love working there!

Hi everyone!

Right now I'm 100% remote and I make 115k in a HCOL area.

I'm working in software development in healthcare. I find the job incredibly boring. I was working in space/satellites before I made the transition to healthcare two years ago.

I've casually been looking for jobs back in space and I've made it through the final rounds interviews in a job that is in a research lab that develops software for satellites. I'm just waiting to hear back to see if I got the job.

Obviously the base salary difference isn't a big difference however this potential new company offers 25% of your salary into your 401k without any contributions on my end. I could potentially retire very early which has always been a dream of mine.

I'm getting cold feet about leaving my job. I love working from home but I don't see myself in this job forever and this opportunity sounds like a great step for my career.

In addition to the 25% to my 401k they offer health care through an IBA that's worth 25% of my salary. Any money I don't use that month on healthcare I receive back. My total compensation would be around 182k.

Just wanted to vent/ here others peoples thoughts.

I hope this was coherent!

Edit: My commute would be less than 25 minutes and my hours could be flexed.

I believe companies and the media will try to change the outlook of WFH on the next generations that are coming up (theres already articles coming out about how Gen Z "dislikes remote work", give me a break). It's quite clear the self prophecy of a "recession" can be used as a means to exploit workers, especially poorer and financially unstable ones like younger generations starting life with debt.

I just hope Gen Z knows and realizes that older generations (mainly gen x, millennials, and progressive minded boomers) got their back and that they should keep up the fight for WFH. because, I think its going to be a drawn out war.

It’s kinda bewildering when you think about it…

Basically, If a manager can’t determine whether a remote worker is performing adequately, then that means their main indicator at the office was the employee physically “looking busy.” If they had literally any other way to measure it, then they could measure it remotely.

I suppose it’s possible they don’t actually know how long each task should take, or how much work should get done within a given period, but that’s actually worse.

I’m in the process of looking for a new job and while my preference would be full WFH, I would be okay going into an office on a rare occasion (couple times a month max). After 8 interviews with “hybrid” roles, I have realized that hybrid can literally mean anything the company wants it to.

This role is hybrid meaning we want you in 3 days a week.

This one is hybrid BUT everyone in this role is usually in the office every day.

2 days a week, 1 day a week, 2x a month… literally all over the place. And of course they don’t put any of these details in the job description so you have to go through the process long enough to talk to a recruiter to ask the question. I’ve left in the middle of 3 interviews because of this and every time they are truly shocked I would do that. “I’m sorry but we don’t need to continue this conversation any further. The expected in office time won’t work for me and it would have been nice to know this ahead of time so I didn’t waste both our times.”

Please explain to me, how all of these fortune 500 companies have produced record profits, year after year since COVID in 2019, and yet, they consistently call for an end to WFH?

Record Profits means employees are working harder, goals are being met, employee moral is up, etc.

And yet they constantly just blatantly lie about worker productivity.

I saw one a few days ago on LinkedIn that some actually AGREED with, that said one of the main arguments from WFH vs. in the office was "You can understand tone of voice." I kid you not. People actually agreed. Apparently people are brainwashed enough to believe that tone of voice comes across in the office but not over the phone. Let alone a video call.

I save an average of $300 a month by working from home vs going into the office. They've now initiated a "program" where if you work remotely more than 3 days a week you lose your office. Which ok cool. I won't be coming in. Right? Oh, no. Your supervisor still has the right to deny full time work from home. So guess who not only can't WFH full time. But also loses their office and has to share a desk on an entirely different floor as the rest of the team. I thought this was about teamwork and relationship building?

Orrrr you can keep your office by coming in 3 days a week or more.

Please someone make it make sense. Other than the lies you tell yourselves to get away from your family.

It's not a punishable offence, but it can quickly develop a patern of people recognizing " Days in the office are better when X is remote...."

i’m a software engineer and i also work with hardware, so i often have to go into the office. during the pandemic, i would go into the office whenever i need to be in the lab, which was usually two days a week. there was no traffic, i could leave early, and im immunocompromised and no one was there, it was perfect.

at the beginning of april, my employer required we come in the office at least two days a week. i was thinking it wouldn’t be too bad because that’s what i had already been doing. but i was wrong.

ever since all these companies have been requiring people to come back, the traffic has been horrible, and now there’s more people at the office coming i coughing and sneezing, if i have nothing that requires me to be in the office, i still have to go and it just feels like such a waste of time and energy.

i’m new in my career so i will probably stick around for a while because i do think being in the office has helped me learn, but i was learning just fine before it was required. taking away people’s choices does not make for better productivity, it actually severely harms it.

once i’m comfy in my career, i’ll only be appplying for remote jobs with hybrid optional.

I quit a WFH job 6 months ago, and was told they would send me a box to mail in my laptop, but never received anything. I know someone else who left in January, and they never sent him anything either.

Company is fully remote, with an “HQ” around 1,000 miles away from where I live. No company software installed, everything was through Google suite. Browsers have a tracking add-in that monitors what you do, I can’t remove it and if I uninstall/reinstall the browser it shows back up.

I rarely use a laptop for personal use, most anything I do can be done from my phone, but thinking about turning it into a plex server to host personal media vs going out and buying a computer. I really want to spin up something like plex, so it seems like a win if I don’t have to buy a computer and just need to get the storage.

If this were to hypothetically happen to someone, WWYD? Other than the “remote” off chance they actually ask for it back, anything to watch out for if I go the plex server route?

Edit: forgot to add this was with a startup, not sure if it’s relevant. I was only there around 6 or 7 months before realizing they were never going to stop hemorrhaging money and my equity was worthless.

I had this job as an academic counselor in 2021 and I was a team lead along with 4 other people. We 5 had a meeting with our boss who asked us our opinion on staying remote or bringing everyone back to the office.

I was the first to talk. I explained I didn't feel comfortable returning to office, especially because the pandemic was still pretty bad. I said it was also an unnecessary risk because we could do our jobs just fine remotely. To my surprise, the others didn't back me up. They said COVID wasn't a big deal and strongly said we should return to the office.

One of them was against sick pay leave because he said people abused it with no proof, so I guess this was consistent with his other shitty opinions.

Edit: Before commenting "COVID is not a valid reason anymore", please read the full post. This all happened in 2021

I wanted to get some opinions on a continuous argument I have with my spouse. I work fully remote (with some travel here and there) my spouse works primarily in the office, working from home a day or so a week usually. His commute when he does go into the office is about an hour one way with traffic. Everyday I log in at 7am and work until about 5. He leaves for work at 7am and gets home at 6. When I log off of work I tidy up the house and make dinner every day so it is ready when he gets home. I expect is that he cleans up afterwards. His usual argument is that he has to work all day and be in the car for 2 hours, while I have more time because I WFH, so he shouldn’t have to do it. I disagree, and we often argue about it. I don’t think him having a long commute should negate him from doing chores. What do you all think?

Update: Wow, lots of comments and advice! I appreciate you all. :) As for tonight… I made dinner again, he came home. I told him from now on if he wants to eat my food he has to clean up after. If not he can cook his own food and clean his own dishes and i’ll clean mine. He decided he was going to do the dishes and eat my food. Hopefully this becomes a new habit.

Every day I see another story about so and so coming out against WFH (Elon Musk, Marta Stewart to name a few). It's blatantly obvious that they've been told by their stock brokers that if American workers continue to WFH it will negatively effect their portfolios because of commercial real estate holdings. Of course it's couched in moral terms ("They're becoming soft and lazy without that 2 hour daily commute! It's un-American!").

I haven't seen as much press about all of the incredible benefits for the environment, and the family and quality of life.

Are there any PR people out there that can help turn the tide a little? I feel like it's becoming a political issue and we need to get in front of the bad press.

Starting a new job and the offer looks pretty good, but I’m naturally nervous of being scammed. An HR person from the company saw my portfolio and messaged me off Indeed and did a “text based” interview which was odd to me but allowed me a little more time for the answers. They offered me the job this morning and want an answer by EOD.

They will be sending me a work laptop and want me to buy specific supplies through an “approved vendor,” not sure what this means.

I looked up the HR person on Indeed and found their profile and everything matches. This is a big company who is recognize able too.

How are sensitive documents like tax documents normally exchanged?

I have terrible sleep issues. Either I can't sleep or I wake up in the middle of the night. I am a zombie by morning time. Being able to wake up later and not have to get ready while being tired as hell is the biggest damn advantage. I look really tired too but it's much more manageable when your at home

That's really it. It is awesome they are giving us this perk. I already am left alone and able to manage my schedule, come and go as I please, but for extended periods of time, 2+ days, we had to pull from 15 days of PTO. Now, we just request through our manager, and if approved, we go. No PTO pool anymore. Just wanted to share.

EDIT: this kinda blew up. I'm really hopeful that this will be a good thing for me and my coworkers. Can someone please remind me to update in 6 months if I've been laid off/how much PTO time I have taken. I will try to keep track, or will ask my manager for his count when I am being laid off lol

I WFH and love it. Sadly the company I work for is badly organized and it drives me nuts. The day to day can be chaotic and I often feel on edge. Debating taking an in person role to get out of a negative environment. I keep second guessing myself because I live the benefits of working from home. Anyone been in a similar position?

My job is FAR from perfect…however, today after a three day weekend (I had a pre-thanksgiving dinner for my kids and their significant others last night) when I’m exhausted and the weather is gloomy - I’m so happy I can just do my job in peace and not have to drive in the rain, get dressed etc. - if I had to go to the office today I may have called out.

For context, I was hired as a remote employee in summer of 2020. They recently forced us to go back to the office 2 days a week. At first I was kind of excited to get some interaction and meet everyone...but it has turned my formerly positive view of the company and management into pure disgust..

There is NO "culture" there. We don't interact with anyone on our own team hardly, let alone others. The managers walk around all smug and like they own the place without having any involvement on the floor. My manager regularly is watching YouTube and gets mad when anyone tries to get her attention for help or to ask a question (too busy playing games, watching YouTube, or listening to music; how dare we bother her with work!)...they have one microwave for 50 people and so it's either bring cold lunch, pay a ton for eating out, or wait for 30-45 minutes to use the microwave then have to scarf down your meal.. They offer the cheapest, most crappy snacks (generic granola bars and chips) but recently upper management sent out an email telling people to keep tgr snack limit at 3 per day and no more ("otherwise may have to rethink offering this benefit")...I ABSOLUTELY HATE it!! I've lost all respect for the company, my immediate managers, and especially upper management. I get to spend time and $$ commuting in order to secure their tax breaks and do 3x the work for far less pay than even my immediate, useless manager.

I'm applying elsewhere, but honestly, my morale and mental health have taken a nosedive and I'm on the verge of quitting with no backup. I know that is stupid and not a good idea, but i have become so anxious and depressed (already have a history of bipolar disorder and severe generalized anxiety disorder)...

TLDR: I literally went from kind of looking forward to a couple days in office to meet people and break the years of isolation, to crying and a nervous mess a full 24-48 hours before office days and losing any ounce of respect I had for management and the company as a whole...

Sorry just had to vent....if anyone has ideas to get out of this situation as fast as possible, please let me know. Thank you for letting me get that out

I got a 4% increase last year. This year it’s 2.2% with a small Christmas bonus. I’m definitely grateful don’t get me wrong. Just bummed it wasn’t as big as last years despite having great performance this year…but I guess since last year was a decent increase I’m assuming this year they kept it lower to balance out.

Sometimes I just need to. All my work is done when I do this and I keep my computer with me. Am I the only one? Will I forever be labeled a “lazy millennial” on my own little island? 😂

So I applied for a job online that said REMOTE. Company is about 100 miles from where I live. I applied and got an email for an interview. During the interview they said the job is on-site. Not remote, not hybrid but ON-SITE. Why!??!?!? Oh it is remote to start whilst they finish building and up fitting the office. So I f I can work remote first few weeks why bother having a building for people to come into. In BFE of all places?!?!

I accidentally found out about my upcoming termination. It’ll be before the weekend. A coworker asked my boss how they should deal with my clients on a group call. They did this thinking I was aware. In reality I was actually never told and was getting increasingly stressed about how unclear my role was becoming. I’ve spent weeks thinking I was crazy but turns out I was right to be distrustful.

I work in tech support and have been there a year. I can’t truly afford to be let go but I’m happy to get out of the toxic hell and find something else. What should I do now I know? I copied files I think I may need. Anything else I should do before the meeting?

Update: Thank you all for the advice. It kept me sane today and that kindness was more than I experienced in the job. I got the meeting invite this morning and was fired. It turns out it was a large layoff. This is a reminder for you all that a job is only that and you should not Killy ourself for any role.

There were three of us total in an office that can hold 25 or so people. I sat in an office and talked to another WFH guy who was forced to come in. We talked for 5.5 hours. About 1/3 work talk, 1/3 corporate politics, and 1/3 hobby/business ideas.
We took a 1/2 hour break and then got onto separate conference calls in separate offices for an hour. When I finished mine I went home. 7.5 hours total.

I never turned on my computer.
I feel cultured.

A new report released Tuesday by Scoop, a hybrid work management startup that also compiles the data set Flex Index, includes an analysis of remote work policies and revenue growth at 554 public companies done in partnership with the Boston Consulting Group. It found that the average public company that gives employees choice over whether to come into an office also outperformed on revenue growth over the past three years by 16 percentage points, compared to companies with more restrictive policies.

When a bartender in Prague (where I just went to recently) gets 6 weeks of vacation a year with the free healthcare and other benefits (yes I know their salaries are lower than ours), you really have to question things.

WFH has been the only thing that makes sense to me that catches us up to our European counterparts. Although I still had to work, I have been able to travel to places I wouldn't have even considered traveling to if I had to use just 10-15 days vacation while being stuck in an office 5 days a week.

That’s all, really. WFH appreciation post.

Right now I’m required to go on-site once a week and I often have to go in a little more due to classified work I have do on-site, but I always have my eye out for fully remote positions.

I love WFH. I never understand why someone wouldn’t love it. I’m more productive and can get tasks done faster without coworker distractions. There’s no commuting, i get to sleep in, no having to get up earlier to primp or look presentable. I’m saving money on gas and taking back my own time. I love being with my dog all day. I love that if i need a five-minute break, i can unload my dishwasher or sweep the floor or something. Ultimately saving time on that invisible work at home, because i can do micro tasks at home while I’m taking just a short break from work. All my food is here, i get to use my own bathroom, if I’m not feeling well, all my preferred meds are here. I love not feeling pressured to perform friendliness with coworkers.

I could WFH for the rest of my life. It’s the best.

I have been wfh for 11 years and the company decided mandatory 3 days per week starting after Labor Day. There are 2 designated days (Tues & Wed) and 1 day of your choice.

The company policy about it includes monitoring of your attendance and threats of termination if you dont cooperate. They have a statement saying that the company reserves the right to consider an employees refusal to abide by the policy as a voluntary resignation of employment.

My boss had a meeting with me on Tuesday telling me that I had to do it. I told him that this is a huge hardship and its going to turn my life upside down. He was not happy himself as his commute is now 1 1/2 hours. This is being driven from the top down.

I am not sure how this is even legal as the are changing the terms of employment.

I already started looking for a job. My view is if they are going to force me to go in than I can work anywhere for more money. I had stayed at this company because of the wfh. With this radical reduction there is no reason to stay.

Its time for office people to join a union. They have tried this in the past and failed. Has it dawned on everyone that you have no leverage.

Certain companies (Crossover, Trilogy) have implemented a screentracking program called WorkSmart that not only tracks cursor movements (coming up with a “focus score” and an “intensity score” that can be practiced to assess the rate of contractors), but takes screengrabs and pictures of the employee through the webcam every ten minutes.

(Allegedly, the program needs the employee to be looking directly into the camera, too.)

Does anything else quite so severe like this exist for remote work? Does this make any sense for anyone doing any kind of qualitative work / who has any sort of emotional needs beyond a robot's?

Comments? Workarounds? Fears?

I mean a return to the office. I work in one of the most expensive cities in the country if not the world- Boston. There are rumblings that we are going to be required to come in more days. If anyone knows the current situation of the Boston public transit system, it is expensive and unreliable. I’m already living paycheck to paycheck. My wallet -and sanity- cannot let myself sit in a freezing gray cubicle for absolutely nothing. I simply can’t. And they don’t care. They don’t care if people leave. It’s all so damn depressing

Doing exactly what I'm currently doing, but my company went fully back into the office AFTER 3 YEARS REMOTE! (Needless to say employees are not happy)

I'm elated!!!

For me it's eating healthier meals, especially lunch. When working in an office I used to almost always eat out for lunch. Now I eat very healthy lunches which I prepare and eat at home, often including a salad with half a dozen fresh veggies. I do all the prep work at Noon, and eat from 12:15-12:45ish. Then I clean up, never in a rush unless there's a pressing work deadline. I've lost 15 pounds and feel better overall.

Sir James Dyson thinks the UK's plans to allow employees to continue working from home are "staggeringly self-defeating."

Kevin Ellis, the UK PwC chairman said that AI will kill off the WFH culture.

In the UK there is a quite a lot of pressure to work at the office and there are very few jobs that are fully remote although half of government workers are remote but they get paid substantially less than the private sector.

The economic situtation in the UK is causing people to be nervous. I know people that got made redundant (laid off) in the last couple of weeks. I am expecting my company to push for 5 days in the office from the 3 days they currently expect. I am not someone that is a fan of fully remote, but I would hate not being hybrid and would prefer 2 days a week in the office and 3 at home. Later in life I do want fully remote so that I can live a digital nomad life as my kids will have left home.

Are you also experiencing a lot of pressure to return to the office and are you finding less jobs are fully remote? What's going on in your part of the world?

A week ago, I posted about the anxiety I had about RTO with the never-ending layoffs happening in my company:

https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/16blq19/hybird_role_became_fulltime_and_toxic_in_the/jze13pl/

Today, it finally happened, and boy, oh boy, let me tell you how massively relieved I am not to go to that stinking and depressing office five days a week. My probation meeting was absolute BS, with no constructive criticism at all. Most of the time was spent talking about being on time, punctuality schoolboy shit that I threw at my manager's face telling him I knew I was fired because the company was going broke, not because of my work ethic. Ever since I started working at this company in April, I showed up every day and took one day off and one sick day, and he dared to tell me my work wasn't good enough when according to him, I smashed through my KPIs within three months. RTO nowadays is an excuse for your company to fire you when things aren't going great. It's insane how they want us back in the office when fuel prices are high, train fares are high, and food costs are skyrocketing to the point where you either have to starve yourself in the office to have some savings at the end of the month. I am back on the job hunt again, but I am so glad this nightmare has ended. There would be days when I would wake up and think, what if this train I am on would have an accident so that I can die and not have to deal with this BS. I won't be surprised if this company gets liquidated next year because the morale in the office would honestly make me cry in the stinking toilet cubicles. Wish me luck on my job hunt, guys. I am going to need it!

I started with this company late last year after my last company went from remote to 5 days a week in the office.

Anyway I was hired as with this new company as hybrid with the expectation that I would come into the office twice a week. I would come in and often leave after 4-5 hours to avoid traffic and finish up from home with no issues.

Two months ago the company made it mandatory for all hybrid employees to come in 2 days a week. I’m guessing that hybrid employees didn’t really come in, but this was a none issue for me.

During my weekly one on one with my lead I was told that I need to be in the office for 8 hours on the days when I come in. I would understand if I came in for an hour and left, but that’s not the case and now I want to look for completely remote opportunities because it’s apparent they are monitoring our badging in and out.

EDIT: I want to make it clear that when I go into the office for 4-5 hours and leave, I go back home and continue working.

Not joking here, 100% serious.

The Netherlands is the world leader in vertical farming. Much of the country is below sea level meaning a scarcity of arable land, but they have a population of 17M people to support. 20 years ago the Dutch began to develop technologies that have led to them becoming one of the largest EU exporters of foodstuffs.

The main reason the corporations and 1%ers want RTO so bad is to save their commercial real estate investments, right? What if the office building owners expelled all the people, then used the space to grow food? The big skyscrapers in cities would save huge amounts on distribution alone, the food doesn't have to come to the city from a farm across the country it can just be sold out the back door of an office building downtown.

EDIT: there are many people on the team - only two of them besides the managers live in the same state as the office.

We live 1 1/2 hours away from the office. He is only 1 of 2 employees on his team aside from the two managers that even live in the same state as the office.

His manager agreed with him how stupid it was for him to come in and sit on zoom meetings all day. However, this was the directive from on high and as an incentive they gave him a $3,500 raise “just because.” I think it was to offset the cost of commuting.

He agreed to Thursdays being the day he and his co-worker would go in. He shows up last Thursday and it’s like the Wild, Wild West - tumbleweeds could have been floating across the barren office landscape.

Nobody else, including the two managers, showed up. He stayed until noon and then booked it back home. Held zoom meetings on his phone on the commute.

Thank God we have an electric car - at least we didn’t have to pay for gas!

I’ve been WFH since 2019 but when I was in office we would do the same stupid and embarrassing tradition for every one of our 15+ team members.

Maybe this was a bit different for you all, but I think the general concept was a long-standing tradition for office jobs.

On someone’s birthday we’d all sneakily pass around a birthday card and write a nice message which was fine enough, but then their manager would hold a fake meeting with the person, which gave the rest of us time to sneak into the kitchen to set up a cake with candles. When the manager brings them to the kitchen, we all start singing happy birthday.

For the birthday “victim,” unless they were a type A, it was a totally embarrassing an awkward moment. It was then the birthday victim’s (WTF) responsibility to cut the cake and pass a slice to every one else. They would then sometimes feel obliged to read the birthday card they were given out loud.

I made sure when I first started that my birthday could not be public knowledge to my manager or the rest of the team but Jesus Christ did I feel second hand embarrassment for everyone else.

I wonder if this still happens…

Not upset just curious. I see people on here more often then I'd expect saying they have a bunch of free time and they still get paid like they are working.

For those who know/had/have a job like this what kind of field were you in? What did you do for those hours?

I knew the end of the covid emergency would be the excuse they were looking for but basically they had a rule in place prior to covid and that rule goes back into effect once the covid emergency is over. This means that without ordering us back, they just make it so job duties that happen daily will need to be handled in the workplace.

This essentially means that I probably will have all of 30 days telework per year, and to me that isn't even worth it.

In 3 years you have thought they would have found a way to change this silly rule but they never will because basically, the people charged with changing it... want to be in the office. They drive in and park in the parking garage for free. So of course they don't mind being in. Many of them live within walking distance in mansions that cost millions.

I can't take going back to the bad old days of the public transportation and 12 hour work days because that transportation is so dysfunctional and takes so long.

I can't help but be very angry and the employees who also were pushing this and are now pretty gleeful. Most of whom do live close because they are wealthy or happened to get low income housing close by.

Bummed out.

I started a new role that is mainly remote and my family totally disregards my work because I WFH. My mom and grandma in particular, call me all day long and want to have 30+ min conversations. Just today I had to tell gma, “believe it or not … I am at work. I’ll talk to you later.” It was kind of amusing at first but now it’s getting annoying, and I have to repeatedly ignore their calls throughout the day to set my boundaries.

Does anybody have this issue with family or friends?

Edit: We got the exception my boss did it!!!! Whoever sent good vibes and wishes TY 😊

He said we would revisit sometime next year but were good till then!!!!

I am sooooo relieved. Thank you, everyone, for the support ❤️

Hired December 2022 fully remote. Was told the position would remain fully remote and I made it extremely clear I would not accept this offer if there was an RTO chance and was told no fully permanent remote. Gucci

Well.........

RTO unit announcement last Monday. Everyone must RTO. The only person who got a pardon on my team was hired out of state.

We have an extremely small team only 5 of us and 3 said they would quit in the RTO meeting.

My boss is the vp..he said he would do his best to convince his boss that our team should stay WFH.

We find out our fate tomorrow.

I'm dreading it.

I love my job. I make 75k salaried with great benefits.

I would hate to lose this job because of something so unnecessary 😒

The thought of looking again and going through all of that also seems daunting

It really sucks to know that employers really don't care at all about their employees. We are basically slaves to them.

Something needs to change.

Everyone needs to rise up together. If we stand together and say no they will be forced to change.

You'd hope...

My supervisor has been concerned about the lack of in person communicating for months and wants to bring people back in at least 3-4 days a week (basically pre- pandemic). His biggest peeve?

He misses being able to walk up to people and asking questions. I told him I prefer not to have walk ups, I have meetings and research and often would need to follow up for responses.

He responds by saying "Are people walking up to you really that bad so you can answer quickly?" To me, I did not like co-workers walking up behind me 5+ times a day and love the WFH life as I get more done. It's not necessarily that I hate talking to co-workers, but since I'm an attorney there's simply not often there's a simple explanation I can provide on the spot. For those that read and interpret regulations and laws you understand, one word can be debated forever.

Did you have to deal with a ton of walk ups and do you find them beneficial? I tend to find them more annoying when someone stands behind my cube for a second and suddenly says my name. Not to mention when concentrating which again is something that is often it throws me off.

As long as you’re not creating more work for others I don’t see the problem with it. I do my actual assignments at work but nothing extra:

I don’t turn my camera on for meetings

I don’t attend in-person events

I do go on errands during work hours if I’ve finished all my tasks and don’t need to be in any meetings

Wfh has given people the opportunity to drop a lot of the unnecessary stuff at work and just do exactly what they truly need to do. From what I’ve read online, people seem to think this attitude makes you a bad employee but I’ve always gotten positive reviews.

I do understand it could be ‘bad’ for career development if your bosses look at more than just performance. People who treat work this way may not get the best raises or promotions and all that.

However I get the feeling that people consider this bare minimum attitude bad in the sense of being a slacker and ‘ruining wfh for others’. Curious what others think of this.

This thought may not be fully baked, so bare with me. I work remote but spend a few days in the office once a quarter or so. I’d say my workplace is pretty laid back and my coworkers are all really nice.

Previously, I worked in-office at a different company doing the same role.

I’ve realized that during my in-office visits and for a couple days after, my stress levels are MUCH higher…. because I’ve become privy to workplace drama and I’m now (subconsciously) carrying this mental load in addition to just, ya know, doing my job.

At my old job, I realize now that I carried this stress constantly. This person doesn’t like that person. This person is HR’s favorite. This person is rumored to be getting fired. This person in a completely different department dropped the ball on this project. This person put fish in the break room microwave. Et. Al.

I am definitely empathetic/neurodivergent, so I’m sure others may not be as affected by this as me… but man, having to “carry” all of that information all of the time so I could try to stay in good graces with everyone was such an energy suck.

I’m so much happier and more productive not having to deal with the relationship complications that come from spending 8 hours a day with the same people.

At my current job, I NEVER have any idea what workplace drama might be going on. I just get to happily live in my own peaceful world at home and make sure my job is getting done. When I go into the office and spend time around my coworkers I learn so much interpersonal information that I’d frankly rather not know. Thankfully, it’s very infrequent and now that I’m conscious of what’s happening and how it makes me feel I’m able to process it more quickly and move on.

But man… I can’t believe that I used to just… deal with that - all of the time. Just another reason that almost no amount of money could get me back in office.

Some people telecommute, some are in-office, but in an open floorplan office. It's impossible to hear these people with all of the background talking and shouting etc.

And then when it comes to some people being in some conference room, I have to wait for conversations to finish, or people to wander around looking for each other because they don't respect their own calendar. Meanwhile the people at home seem to not have this trouble.
And they've invented so much technology for meetings, but I never see any corporation use it, always the standard horrible sounding stuff.

Is this the definition of "collaboration"? Being distracting, noisy, and unorganized? #notimpressed

There is still hope for finding remote jobs. I was recently laid off - my company had 3 rounds so far this year, so I started applying after the 2nd round in June as I knew I may be on list #3. I had a couple offers right away but turned them down hoping I wasn't going to be laid off. Well in August it happened.

I kicked my search into high gear, and applied for about 50 jobs a week. It really is a numbers game now, you can't get to excited about a specific opportunity or you will get frustrated and disappointed just stay open for whatever is next. I was ghosted a lot and still receive notifications daily that the "job is on hold due to changing strategies/economic conditions" blah blah. But there are tons of jobs out there. I was only considering jobs where I can WFH as I have for over 10 years. I do have a lot of connections/followers but didn't receive referrals as most of my friends' companies are laying off too so I was on my own. I am very active on Linkedin, not creating content but I think it helps liking posts, share content just interacting with people in general I have people reach out to me all day. I had the green banner on for a few weeks but took it down as I was getting a lot of spam.

So here I am. Now I have 4 offers, turned down 2 and I took one of the FT roles offered. There is 4th a contract role heavily pursuing me, and I'm going to try overemployment. Does anyone have experience with OE and balancing meetings and their workload? I have joined the OE Sub and wow it is interesting to see. I'm starting both jobs around the same time so should be interesting. One of the companies is very fast-paced so I'm not sure I can pull it off but gotta try. Love to hear any advice/experience to stay above water and succeed. TIA

I don’t. If someone was traveling, but was a great team mate who was super responsive I truly don’t give a rats ass where they work from.

I got a remote job and most of my coworkers are older with families and own houses. I’m the youngest on the team and I want to travel a bit. I’ve told two of them during our weekly meetings that I sometimes work from a coworking space in my hometown. The rest of the time I’m at home. But sometimes people have commented on my surroundings in a suspicious way like “are you outside?”

Believe it or not, I work better from a coworking space. I’m more focused. Even though I don’t have a monitor. I get way more done and sometimes even skip lunch. But I feel….bad? From working from a coworking space. Or even not joining a call on video. But sometimes I just don’t want people to know where I am

Started hybrid in 2017, full time WFH since 2019. It's sanctioned (in writing) by 1st & 2nd-level managers - but always in a "don't ask, don't tell" fashion.

Got a ping yesterday from the SVP's assistant - was I still using my office on the 10th floor? (Yeah, *that* office... that I haven't set foot in during business hours since 2020).

"Nope - not using it."

"OK, no problem - we're reassigning it to someone else."

They gave it away! Hallelujah! Clouds parted! Angels sang! Hosanna to the highest!

No more name on the door of an empty office - no more entry on the "you are here" board. Stealth mode achieved.

Does anyone else feel bogged down—both online and with in-person conversations with friends and family—from folks who are hell bent on “working from home” and think that working from home IS the job, rather than having a job and working from home/working remotely is the location?

In this sub we get multiple posts per day about people who are interested in “entering the field of work from home” or “looking for any or all work from home jobs” and with little information and very little semblance of what they want to do, they just know what they want to work from home or work remotely. I’ve seen this in other subs as well, where folks with very little experience in the working world period are looking for non-phone working from home jobs or very high paying working from home jobs. No mention of industry…just “hey, are there any high paying jobs I can do from home?”

I’m also currently dealing with this with a friend right now; she has been unemployed for a year now and was offered three hybrid positions in her field (anywhere between 1-2 days per week in the office), one position of which I actually facilitated the introduction with a recruiter because she was complaining about not having a job and truly did have the skill set, but has turned them down because she wants to work remote by any means necessary (trust and believe, I will NEVER do that again). The bills are piling up and she’s even asked my family for money, but she refuses to take the hybrid positions because she wants to “work from home.”

I do want to try to be helpful for folks who are seriously looking for work, but a majority of the conversations people seem to want to have don’t even appear to be serious…just a “hey, how can I get a work from home job? I want a work from home job!” sentiment and that’s about it.

I’m ranting at this point, but just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same.

So I see a lot of dislike for recruiters online but the truth is they are the ones that tell companies what the job market is like.

At the moment we are seeing a push back on Working From Home and a great way to push back on that is through recruiters.

The next time you get messaged on LinkedIn by one and they mention that it's not remote.

Make sure to tell them that you're turning it down because it's not remote.

Even if you were going to turn it down for other reasons making the fact that it's not remote will go a long way to help us all out.

Yesterday, I got offered a FULLY REMOTE JOB!!!! The pay is more than what I currently made at my last hybrid position, and I couldn’t be happier and more ecstatic to finally be on this side of WFH!!

Unfortunately it’s not permanent employment to start—it’s contract with a high possibility of being hired on permanently. The contract is 9 months and starts in October. I’m so, so, so very happy. ❤️

Now…I want to find a second remote job so I can make gravy money. 👀 I have no debt and neither does my fiancé, but I’d really love to start building our comfortable wealth ASAP.

Any tips/thoughts for a new WFH person??

I went into the office for the first time in 3 years yesterday... it took all of 5 mins for me to want to leave... people are so fucking loud.. like all day people just yapping about the dumbest shit.. People constantly coming by my desk "HEY YOU STILL WORK HERE?!?!" like yes fuck face.. I do. One dude came over and he was chomping on an apple while talking to me and legit spit apple all over the place.

The best part is.. everything I did from the office I can do from home.. they had a meeting and everyone dialed in from their desk. it makes zero sense..

I'm sorry, but the days I'm in the office feels like a complete waste of time. I do the same work as I do at home, but in the office I get micro-managed, listen to office gossip idc about and waste money commuting to a building.

Anyone else in the same predicament?

Was on a conference call that was on everyone’s calendar since last Monday. One of the participants kept going on mute, but when they needed to contribute we could barely hear them due to the background noise. They finally said “I’m sorry. I’ll have to follow up later.” This was a team meeting, and usually what happens in the team meetings stays in the team meetings. When the employee got home he apologized and said him and his wife were taking their dog and kid out for a walk and couldn’t get back home in time. Fucking for real? This wasn’t a last minute meeting. It was on the calendar for EIGHT DAYS! I’m a big WFH advocate and push for it as much as I can. We are back to three days in the office, up from two last year. I told him he owes me one and he was cool with it. I also told him it can’t happen again. Last minute call, sure I get it. You might not be there. Eight days in advance? No excuse other than a last minute emergency on your end, and taking a walk with your family ain’t an emergency.

These companies are still out there but my god the job market is really bad and honestly I just got lucky. Hundreds upon hundreds of applicants all fighting over the same positions. If not even thousands for remote jobs.

Any way, y'all got any tips and tricks for me to make my life / job easier from you vets?

This is why WFH is here to stay and will expand after this initial backlash fades. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-14/work-from-home-jobs-are-good-for-companies-revenue-growth-study-shows?embedded-checkout=true

I know a lot of the posts recently seem to be people with RTO orders, but honestly, I found a WFH job with great pay after a month of looking. With the state of the modern worker, I feel like we are in the position to demand or expect decent pay and decent work conditions. WFH is a great plus that employers can offer employees as incentive to find the best of the best. And that is great incentive to retention. Just a thought. What do you guys think?

I work hybrid 2 days WFH and today is the first day I’ve ever had at my job where I truly just underperformed. I worked from 9 to around noon then just dicked around the rest of the day. Probably gonna have to finish Sunday what I should have been doing today. Normally I am extremely disciplined when working from home, in fact I like that I’m allowed to be unreasonably concentrated on something at a socially-unacceptable level with minimal office distraction.

I feel extremely guilty about it and wish I would have done more but it is what it is. Anyone else have days like that? Is that normal sometimes?

“When we’re in the office, now I can just come up to your desk and ask a question directly and bounce ideas off of each other”

This is my favorite one.. being in IT, most of my peers on my team and most of the people I support are almost never just a couple of desks away. For me being in office or at home doesn’t change it, you’re going to have to message me and or hop on a call. On that note of messaging and hopping on a call, I just don’t get it. They say they can now just ask a question in office, what’s stopping you from just asking me while we’re all at home???

I am employed in UK and work remotely for the National Health Service - we have been fully remote since March 2020 and no signs of returning (we gave up our offices)

All I am seeing now is RTO posts - it's slightly worrying considering how successful wfh has been the past 4 years. I just can't put my head around why the massive step backwards?

Strange. The UK doesn't seem to be having this issue... yet.

There are a lot of people who prefer working from home, and I don't blame anyone for that. Being in an office sucks for a million and one reasons.

I'm wondering who else NEEDS to work from home, for any reason? Like you wouldn't be able to do your job if you had to be at the office, or being at the office would totally screw up some other aspect of your life?

I'm a chronic pain patient and I just can't sit in one position all day, so being at a desk for 8 hours just doesn't work for me. At home, I take my laptop wherever I need to be comfortable - could be sitting cross legged on the couch, sitting at my kitchen table with my feet up on the chair across from me, kneeling on the ground with my laptop on a chair, sitting directly on the ground, whatever it takes to be comfortable enough to get my job done. I've been WFH for about 8 years now thankfully, and I hope I always can.

I'm pretty old. Just a few years from retirement (but please don't call me a boomer because I came after them). When I started working in the 1980s EVERYONE wore a suit and tie to work, even most of the women! It had been that way (except for having women in the workplace) for many decades. That was the way it was going to be forever.

I was working in Washington DC for a defense contractor as a "programmer/analyst" as we were called back in those days (now called a Software Engineer). We all looked like Dilbert except we wore suit jackets.

Somewhere along the way, in the late 1980s, we started hearing about this thing called Casual Friday. In the beginning, it meant not wearing your suit coat and ditching the tie. There was much gnashing of teeth on how this would reflect on our work culture and productivity. But management let us do it because it was something fun and made most of us happy. But many in management hated it. You could tell them because they were the ones that never dressed down. They thought we needed a uniform at work and it was a suit and tie. But they soon lost the war.

Soon Casual Friday became really casual as in jeans and a button-down shirt with sneakers! By the mid-1990s we were just dressing casually every day of the week. Along the way, we had new management come in and they didn't like all this casualness and made us go back to four days a week in suits, but that only lasted for a few months as many top programmers rebelled and just kept wearing jeans. Eventually, management gave up and for most of us wearing khakis or jeans to work 5 days a week in the office is the norm. Then the pandemic came and now we are wearing pajamas all day but that is another story.

The point of this story is that when something like Casual Friday or WFH comes along and revolutionizes the workplace, it's only a matter of time before most people are doing it because a) it saves a lot of money b) it is better for the environment c) the stress and strain of commuting is removed from our lives. This tug of war with management will continue for many years and it may take longer than Casual Fridays did to take over the workplace but eventually, most corporations will shed office space as a way to save money and boost productivity. It might not happen right now as many of them are deeply invested in real estate and tax breaks but eventually, WFH will become the predominant way of working for white-collar corporate office dwellers. It makes too much sense.

I'm just happy that I was lucky enough to be able to do it. It has helped me regain my health and mental well-being and kept me working in a corporate job for longer than I wanted.

This just makes me so upset. It's listed as Remote, but it's hybrid. Only the "right candidate" can be fully remote. So why not list it as hybrid??

Recent study that seems clearly biased. Original article is behind paywall but slashdot has the basic info.

https://news.slashdot.org/story/23/06/30/2256229/remote-work-is-making-americans-less-productive-official-data-shows

https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/6/20/23762655/tech-perk-remote-work-freedom-airbnb-yelp

At its core, the “employment agreement” between an employee and an employer is that the employee is selling time out of their day to their employer, for money. In exchange, the employer gets windows of time where they are allowed to dictate the behavior of the employee however they want, for their own profit or benefit.

As an employee, the fee I demand for my time is proportional to the time I need to take out of my day. Of course it’s more nuanced this, but essentially I don’t care how my employer chooses to spend my time. If they want me to generate useful work tied to my experience, I’ll do that. And if they want me to do jumping jacks and cartwheels all day, I’ll do that too - after all it’s their time that’s been bought and paid for.

The fact that commute time has somehow been culturally exempted from this core agreement is insane to me. It’s additional time being taken out of an employee’s day, where their employer is dictating where they need to be and what they need to be doing.

If in-office work is so much more productive, then employers should be happy to pay employees for their commute time. But here’s the simple truth: No one would be RTO if that commute time was coming out of the businesses bottom line.

Let’s prove it mathematically. The most optimistic (and suspicious) studies I have seen say that in-office work is 10-15% more productive. Meaning for every hour worked, an additional 10-15% output is generated per employee.

Now let’s take an example of an employee with a rather-reasonable 30 minute commute each way. So that’s 60 minutes of commuting per 480-minute (8 hour) work day. That’s an extra (60/480)*100 = 12.5% of time taken from the employee’s day. For a supposed 10-15% increase in output.

See where I’m going with this? Even if we assume these productivity studies are correct, there’s no extra productivity actually being generated. It’s just more time being taken from the employee, for the same price, with no additional benefit for the employee. That’s it. From the employee’s pocket into their employer’s.

Adding in the cost of maintaining an office building, if employers were the ones who had to pay employees fairly for commute time, there would be a 0% chance of RTO. It's only when the true costs of commuting are pushed onto someone else (the employee) that it starts to make sense.

Sounds like in-office work isn't so efficient after all!

I just want to get this off my chest. Spent 6 hours in a planning meeting when half the team is permanently remote and 1/2 decided to go into the office and sit in a conference room and try and conduct a meeting. For six hours, I had to sit there watching them share screens and such while talking to each other and it was nearly impossible to understand because many times multiple conversations were going on. We remote people brought this up several times but they mostly ignored us. I almost screamed at one point, just go back to your desks and put on your damn headsets so I could understand what they were saying... vent over...

I’m home all the time and I feel that I am in a loop. Being in the house 24/7 has ruined my physical health. If I try to do some laundry, wash the dishes, or take out the trash while I’m on my breaks I find myself so uncontrollably tired at the end of the day. My boyfriend bought me a treadmill so I can get myself moving and even walking for 45 minutes can leave me feeling defeated for the rest of the day. I’ve gone to the doctor and all my labs are normal. I just can’t understand why I feel so tired all. The. Time.

I find it hard to keep myself awake and energized. Falling asleep is hard. Waking up early is hard. Not only that, I feel as if I’m not actually working since the rest of my family members actually leave the house and commute to work. It almost feels like I’m not amounting to much. I’m afraid my family members think the same of me.

I apologize if this post is all over the place, but I need some tips on how to snap my mind and body back to the way it was pre-pandemic.

I’m in a engineering role developing things. During Covid everyone went work from home. Between 2020 and 2023 the company even started hiring people as fully remote. Early this year they started mandating 2 days per week, but nobody really tracks it. As of Labor Day they started saying 3 days per week, with the excuse that it was hard to schedule meetings where everyone would be on site. All the while they say we need less meetings and to only invite people who need to be in the meetings.

I’ve still only been going two days a week at most. I won’t do 3. I’d prefer to never be onsite. The work I do doesn’t require it 90% of the time. I think a lot of this decision of forced office return is based on feedback from people who don’t have and never had the ability to work from home- thus jealousy. That and a few boomers who should be retiring anyhow. My bosses take on the matter is that as long as nothing becomes a problem for her she doesn’t care.

Do I just gradually work down to where I’m never on site? Do I tell my boss I plan to move and wish to be officially fully remote? I do want to move away but not immediately. I have a longerish commute- about 45 mins each way- more than most in my office, and paying for this three times a week feels like I’m taking a monetary loss and quality of life downgrade.

What say you?

Both my husband and I WFH full time. I've been working remotely for 1 company for 2 years, but he's been fully remote between 4 or 5 companies over a span of 10 years (as in he worked for approx 2 years at each job, not simultaneously)

Recently he has been job hunting and has been having an awful time. Not even getting "thanks but no thanks" emails for jobs he's wildly qualified for. He signed up for the upgraded LinkedIn trial and saw that there were 400+ applicants for one of the jobs he applied for 😮

I'm wondering if WFH jobs harder to get now that more companies are forcing RTO and people don't want to, so they are mass applying for purely remote positions.

My company survey scores dropped and management said there were a overwhelmingly large amount of people asking for only 2 days in office, we are currently 3 as hybrid but some people have fully remote also.

Why is it that all the older workers mostly people 10-15 years from retirement think that we are going back to 5 days in office?

One of my managers told me they can barely get younger people to come into office at all at this point and they all want fully remote.

What direction do you see things going in the future? It just doesn’t make sense to me that with more technological advances that they demand people in the office 5 days a week. So it’s interesting to me when these older people give these opinions. This coming from a millennial myself.

This is more of a vent but I was with my previous company for 5 years. 2 years full time in office, 2 years fully remote (COVID) and 1 year hybrid 3 days in office. My commute was 1.5 hr in the morning, 1.45 hrs back. Even hybrid I was hating my life with my commute. I was able to get a new job 10 minutes away from home, but fully in the office. I’ve been here 2 months and while it’s a great company, I hate being in the office full time. I have been working from home for a week because I tested positive for COVID and wow am I so much happier. I have time to clean my house, cook my meals, and spend time working outside in my backyard. I’m thinking of starting to submit applications for full time remote jobs because I know I’d be so so much happier.

Edit: thank you for all the responses! And for those of you with not so kind comments, let me be clear: I am a Sr. engineer and I do my job very well in office and at home, however I am HAPPIER being at home. I’d like to note my commute was 10 minutes before school started a couple weeks ago making it 25 minutes there and 30 minutes back. It makes a difference. Also by working outside in my backyard, I meant sitting outside in my garden with my laptop open taking in some sun STILL getting my work done. Something I CAN’T do in the office. Some of you anti wfh people are miserable and it shows.

When do you anticipate that remote work will become the standard practice across the corporate world? Remote work has always been a concept, but its widespread adoption seemed to gain momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, about two years after its initial surge, many companies began reintroducing in-office work. My company is one of those that initially transitioned to remote work and has now moved to a hybrid model. Unfortunately, it also appears they are gradually attempting to shift back to a five-day in-office workweek, which seems to be of particular interest to the boomer high ups.

My question is: Do you believe that remote work will eventually become the prevailing method of work on an industry-wide scale as the Boomer generations phase out, leaving the reins to the millennials? If so when do you think this will occur?

So this is a general rant. Forgive me but I love this group but some things, I think, need to be said.

WFH is not a job. It is where you would do a job. So looking for a WFH job is not right. It's I am looking for a software engineer job that is WFH or an accounting position that's WFH. Also, helps if you mention what country.

Do NOT assume a WFH job is paid for 40 hours and only need to work 15. While some jobs offer a lot of flexibility, not all do.

Abusing the freedom of a WFH job is part of the reason people are being RTO. You're able to go fishing every morning while WFH, awesome. Don't brag about it.

Remember, most entry level jobs are not going to be WFH, especially now. Sort of call center or those types.

If you really want to have flexibility with hours/effort and such, look into outside sales. Sales managers, usually, don't care how many hours you work, as long as the numbers are there BUT once the numbers drop, bye bye.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

In a meeting today, after many questions, HR said ‘you don’t have to agree to it, you just have to understand it is happening’ followed up by if you don’t like it we will hire someone who wants to work here.

It’s refreshing in a way to just be flat out told that you are a cog viewed as entirely replaceable. You have no voice that we can to listen to, so deal with it.

I always knew that was true, but to hear it from the company, even if it was just because they were tired of answering questions about it, was a bit shocking.

Not because I need a job - but because given so much RTO articles are pushed in the press, I find it's important to tell recruiters that cold-call me with hybrid roles that I only work remote.

I suggest everyone who wants to see WFH continue as a standard do the same. Let them know that they'll be missing the best picks if they insist on RTO.

I currently work in a satellite office on the West Coast for an East Coast based company. We had a physical office that they got rid of permanently during Covid. Overall, working for this company for the last 7 years has been incredibly humane. Great benefits, and they have an amazing reputation in the industry. Even the people in the home office only go in 2 days a week, and that is flexible. My boss is wonderful and I’m basically left to my own devices as long as I hit my numbers. It’s really a dream set up.

Living in our area is no longer an option, as we are losing our rental and cannot afford another space that accommodates two people working remotely. We’ve decided to move to the mid-west where I have some family and a couple friends. I talked it over with my direct supervisor, who ran it up the flag pole and told me they will cut my pay 25% when I move. This would take me from $118k to $88.5k. The people in our office do get a pay bump compared to the folks on the East Coast for cost of living, which I think is 15%. If they had told me they’d cut my salary that amount, I would’ve been okay, but 1/4 of my overall worth goes down because of my personal expenses?? It’s not like I’ll magically get Fridays off or my metrics will go down. I’ll be literally expected to do exactly the same work.

Is there a way to push back effectively? Our workplace is very much The Bureaucracy™️. For similar jobs in the area, the pay would be around $100k. I could look for a remote job at a non local institution, which could pay more. I wouldn’t quit without having something else lined up, but it really feels like they aren’t giving me another choice. I’d like to keep my job if possible, but I feel completely insulted by this proposal. The move isn’t happening until late spring, so there’s time to get my ducks in a row. Any advice on how to push back is much appreciated!

I'm sorry, they don't get to tell us what we like and what we don't like. This research is garbage. One of the papers she cites was written in 2003!??! The other looks like a high school kid wrote it. The third article she cites was from June 2020, just months after the pandemic started. Was anyone feeling upbeat about anything back then?

Why would so many people want to remote work if they could? The only circumstance where I would want to work in an office is where it's a couple of miles from my house and I have my own office where I can shut my door. But what she doesn't talk about is how we work in these gawdawful open plan offices where everyone has headphones on to drown out the noise and sits on Zoom calls all day. Oh by the way, they are all downtown in a big city where nobody can afford to live so we have to move many miles outside the city and take on a grueling commute. I bet as a writer for The Guardian, Martha Gill, probably wrote this at a remote location because I doubt The Guardian is paying wages high enough for her to live in downtown London.

My wife recently commented on how much more relaxed I am and a nicer person to be around since we went 100% remote a couple of years ago. How's that for hard evidence?

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/02/working-from-home-mental-health-society

For those that were WFH and suddenly had RTO mandates, how are your teammates? Do people just get back into the regular flow of going to the office again and deal with it? I think they are counting on the fact that humans adjust quickly, and will be upset at first but will eventually just chill out and accept their fate in the office.

Do you think people will just accept this? Or is WFH inevitable, and the market will decide when enough people resign?

I wonder if there is any data showing the trends of WFH jobs vs. office jobs posted, filled, etc.

I live in the great state of Wisconsin and unfortunately, am somewhat lactose intolerant.

I can’t help but have a handful of cheese curds and a scoop of custard sometimes.

Today I have some of the worst gas and had to mute myself in a meeting because I was farting so loud and often.

Keep WFH so I can fart in peace and no one has to hear it or smell it.

And yes, when I did work in an office I would go for walks to fart. It was torture.

If it is all about increased interaction and productivity when collaborating in person are they willing to eliminate all offshore contracts and outsourced offsite work as well and pay prevailing home office wages to ALL employees and contractors?

This is a rant.

I joined a company last year. It's fully remote. I actually remained unemployed for some time just to get a remote job as my previous employer went RTO. Work has been amazing. We haven't missed a single deadline. Everyone is working happily.

We had an AMA with executives a few days back and someone is asking them to have a physical office. What?! This dumbass joins a fully remote company and wants them to have an office and ruin everyone's work-life balance? Great work!

Even though execs don't have a plan to do so. I wish this guy could get an RTO just for him so that he can spend 2 hrs each day in commute. Screw you dude!

Edit: We also have a WeWork space booked for anyone who wants to work in office. This guy just wanted everyone else to join him.

Edit 2: There are some people in comments talking about how wfh is miserable for them. Yes, for some people wfh doesn't work and they need office but just because it doesn't work for you, it doesn't mean that others need to come to office. This should be common knowledge.

"Oh but it's not good for your growth." I think adults can decide what's good for them and what isn't.

"Home is like a prison for me" Maybe, and just maybe, it isn't for others and some people like to be with their loved ones all the time.

It started in 2018 when I joined Doordash as a Software Engineer (100% self taught). Initially I would commute to SF (1.5 hrs each way) but when I started WFHing 3 days a week nobody seemed to care. Eventually I told boss I’d work from their Mountain View office but would rarely show up. Nobody cared.

Then the pandemic hit and I joined Meta as a senior engineer. Worked 100% remotely for 2 years until I quit and joined a web 3 company. Kept working remotely and became an Engineer Manager!

I recently started a startup (HiringCafe - a job board to find remote jobs - LOL) and have been working 100% remotely with my cofounder from day 1. We even got funding from a well known investor in SF.

I hear people complain about how it’s hard to brainstorm ideas and be productive remotely but for me personally I would credit WFH for much of my recent success.

I can’t explain how satisfying it is for me to walk outside of my home to a park and come up with ideas and share them with my cofounder on the phone, then head back to my home office and code up a solution. We collaborate well together and have 0 problems so far. We’re always available to each other though so that definitely helps.

I think it boils down to self discipline and truly enjoying your time while working from home. If it weren’t for the walks in the park or the quality family time at a random time in a day, I don’t think I’d enjoy it as much.

But then again, it might not be for everyone. It certainly is for me though!

title really says it all, im notoriously bad at socializing but always enjoyed working, and made a lot of friendships that way. Now that I've been working from home for 2 years now I only see my family. Even with mega social anxiety I really miss having friends

Edit: ok ok I get it work friends aren't real friends. any socialization is a win for me. I do keep in contact with many people that I used to work with but I was a bartender and they all work the opposite shift I do. During the day, during actual working hours, I miss socializing with people in person. My office is hybrid and people are rarely in there. This was really just a mini vent post, I am not attacking WFH jobs. I enjoy my job very much (besides the socialization part).

A friend recently got the RTO 3 days a week order. It starts in October. They’ve had several conversations with colleagues who are, understandably, pissed. Most of them live close enough that the commute won’t be a problem. The issue is that they know the reason for RTO is the tax incentives by the local government to their company and perks to the execs.

I jokingly said they should protest by refusing to do any business in the area - no buying gas, breakfast, lunch, running errands, shopping, etc. in the area. We play off each other’s jokes all the time so I thought he was just kidding when he said he would tell his colleagues to do the same and spread the word. Well, he wasn’t joking. He has convinced everyone in his office to agree to not spend money in the area where the office is located. They will bring lunches and do all of their spending near their homes since none live in the same city as the office - just close.

I told him I don’t think this will work since the area is an office park and several other companies will also be moving to the area soon. He thinks he can convince employees of other companies to boycott the local businesses during office hours too. They could also risk making things worse like having to pay for parking that’s currently free. I’m concerned he’ll be so focused on this “boycott” that he could lose his job. I’m not sure how to convince him not to take this joke too far, especially since it won’t make a difference.

I almost took a fully remote job that happened to have offices in NYC. It would've been a small salary cut, more stressful and less vacation time. I asked for guarantee they wouldn't rto they said of course. Gut told me no. So guess what, they're returning to office now. I'll stick to my hybrid job now, ride out the job downturn and then only accept a job which does not own or rent any space

Any wonder why big tech management and other public mouthpieces are gaslighting "Return To Office" so hard.

From CRE Daily:

US Banks Face Mounting Pressure as Overdue Commercial Property Loans Reach 10-Year High

Delinquent commercial real estate loans in the US have surged to their highest level in a decade, presenting a growing challenge for building owners.

Rising delinquencies: Over the course of the third quarter, the volume of past-due loans for properties rented to others increased by 30%, amounting to a staggering $4 billion rise to reach $17.7 billion. This information, sourced from industry tracker BankRegData, highlights a $10 billion increase in delinquent loans within just a year. Despite this surge, it's worth noting that only 1.5% of commercial property loans are currently past due.

Concerns in the office sector: Experts in the industry predict that the number of properties facing financial pressure is likely to continue rising, particularly within the office sector. Bill Moreland of BankRegData has described the state of commercial real estate lending as "getting ugly fast." The impact of this trend extends beyond numbers, as property prices are expected to decrease while loan delinquencies continue to rise.

WeWork's influence: The data from the third quarter does not account for the recent bankruptcy filing by WeWork, a major player in the office space rental industry. WeWork's Chapter 11 filing, which allows for lease terminations with minimal financial consequences, has added further strain on building owners. The fallout from WeWork's financial woes has affected major lenders like Wells Fargo, which saw a substantial increase in past-due property loans.

➥ THE TAKEAWAY

Zoom out: Despite the mounting delinquencies, banks have been cautious about declaring defaults or significant losses. Experts anticipate that delinquency rates will continue to rise for at least the next year, indicating that there may be more challenges ahead in the commercial real estate sector. While pain is expected, it will take time for delinquencies to translate into actual losses. Banks are actively exploring loan extensions and restructuring options to salvage assets and avoid drastic devaluation if they must reclaim properties.

Why are companies anti wfh? I understand that some jobs highly benefit from being in person, or are impossible to do from home. But, it seems like companies would appreciate the cost savings of not having to pay for more electricity, maintenance, and janitorial work by not having people in office. It seems like a win win to me.

I'm going through the same thing as all of you. Constantly wondering what the hell is management thinking? Why are they doing this? Are they purposefully trying to make us angry? The answer, unfortunately, is most likely YES. They are trying to force attrition (people quitting) so they do not have to do more layoffs which means better press and a higher stock price. Just always understand that a company is not your family, they do not care, you are dispensable even if it screws your team/org/company up.

Did you unexpectedly get a bad review? Is your mgr suddenly cold and not listening but always telling you whats wrong? Are they forcing some whacked out RTO plan that makes no sense? Yep, they're trying to force your hand. Beyond recommending you update your resume and start applying for new jobs, this is not an advice post but its a reality check. Does it suck? Yes. But once you deal with the reality of the situation, the quicker you can laugh it off and move on to the next job. Love you all, you're the best, keep up the good work and fuck these corporations!

I think it's safe to assume that most of us that WFH are not following any type of dress code. Personally, I'm typically in sweat pants and and t-shirt. I barely brush my hair and have no make up on.
Yet, when I know I'm going to be in a meeting with the higher up or with a client, I make sure I'm presentable from the waist up. I'm wearing a shirt with no logo. I might have eyeliner so that I don't look dead, and my hair doesn't look like it's been through a hurricane. It's a step up from the bare minimum. I've noticed my male coworkers might wear a pole shirt but they aren't wearing any ties. Anyway, the other day in a zoom meeting with a client, a female coworker, looked like she joined the meeting right out of bed. Messy hair bun, spaghetti strap shirt, and a washed up look.
My immediate thought was, "You're the reason why they want us to RTO." Maybe I'm being too harsh.
But I'm just wondering, do you dress up for important zoom meetings?

I work from home most of the time and I realized that I when I visit the office quarterly, I am just not productive. I get distracted a lot more easily than normal and I maybe manage to send out one or two emails compared to when I am at home, it's easier for me to be productive and work since there's nothing going on.

Anyone else experience this?

Well, I just stumbled on this sub and thought I would share my experience after 15 years of WFH for a corporation.

I have never had an office assigned during that entire period, although I have traveled on and off as well. Sometimes for extended times, like 6 to 8 weeks continuous.

Some things I have learned, probably nothing new:

Have a designated office.

Get a solid desk, sitting to standing if possible.

Get a good chair. Cannot say enough about Herman Miller Aerons. Yes, expensive, but I have spent 15 years in one, up to 37 hour stretches.

Get good equipment even if you have to buy it yourself (see 3). Keyboards, mice, monitors, lights, etc.

No more than 10 objects that are not directly related to the job on your desk. I am currently in violation, full disclosure.

Health... mental and otherwise:

Stay hydrated. Keep water or calorie free sports drink nearby. I use tabs to flavor the water, your choice. Love the new Gator-aid "natural" drinks made from watermelon juice and other flavors, sweetened with Stevia. Limiting myself to one per day.

Get physical exercise. Don't care. Just move during the day. My current routine is 30 min splitting logs... because I got logs to split. Some days it is washing the car. Good full body aerobics for 30 min or so if I clean the interior too. Anything is better than walking.

Sleep. Get sleep. Be consistent if possible. Back in the ugly support days I did all nighters 6 or so times a year. Worked late hours and weekends. It sucked... then I pushed back.

Have a hobby. One that requires meeting people outside work. My main hobby is my wife... just kidding! But we do make sure to spend time together. Other hobbies include Cycling and D&D. Both keep me centered and as sane as I get.

Self maintain: Get a haircut. Massage. Mani-Pedi. Whatever... just take care of yourself.

Find comfortable clothes. Wear them. On camera? Yeah... it sucks, find good clothes that meet the standard. I love my thin wool golf shirts. They are very comfy and not hot, but look good.

Separation of work and rest of the life. If possible, close that door or whatever and don't go back until your next work period. I use my desk for other things, like bills and stuff, but I try to not do that if I can avoid it.

Well, I could probably write more... but I got a meeting coming up, feel free to AMA but self identifying questions.

Again addressing an inability to mentor, boss’s proximity bias, and the idea that “being in the office” is the same as actual hours worked (despite probably more distraction than being at home).

Just further proof that corporate America is incapable of adjusting. Not that WFH is actually bad.

So, I started a new job about a month ago (after being unemployed for 6 months and waiting and waiting for 100% remote). I was SO excited to finally land this job. The money and benefits are great. But, now I hate it because it’s literally on the phone all day long with my boss and clients. I’ve worked B2B for so long I’ve forgotten what it was like to work with the general public. Also, although I’m on the east coast I have to work west coast hours which is more difficult than I anticipated- especially when I have to work late.

I guess I was spoiled before when my work was task oriented and my old boss didn’t really care what I was doing as long as I was available and completed my work on or before the deadline.

I get up every morning dreading logging in and look at my bank balance to feel better - it’s the constant phone calls (I’m good at pretending to be personable on the phone, but it’s exhausting to fake it all day).

The thought of applying to more jobs is even more exhausting…I’m hoping at some point this role could lead to another role better suited for me.

Just venting and wondering how people deal with the initial elation of FINALLY getting a wfh job and then realizing it kind of sucks. Thanks for listening.

A month ago my company announces RTO out of the blue, no exceptions. Their ostensible reason was increased collaboration. Personally I don’t work with anyone in my local office, and had been unofficially working from home for years before the pandemic, but now they are going to be checking key card swipes. Sigh.

This week is the first week I have really been back in the office. Yesterday I arranged a meeting in the afternoon, half the people couldn’t attend because they are overseas and were commuting at the time, but that was the only time slot that the rest of the attendees could make. In another meeting I was asked to go on mute because there was too much background noise near my desk, so I couldn’t easily contribute to the discussion. Finally just before I left work a co-worker sent everyone an email letting everyone know he had quit.

I’m not about to quit for various reasons, so it will be interesting to watch how this develops.

We have about 2 years of real world data from the pandemic, backing up the efficacy of remote work.

And then a trash study with tons of confounding variables drops and it’s “HOT OFF THE PRESSES WFH L RTO W EVERYONE!!!!” On every. Single. Website.

RTO…completely remote with glaring success since March 2020 for the entire office to four days per week in office. All the usual bullshit…camaraderie, socializing, team work oh then there are the carrots…pot luck Wednesdays, company sponsored cookouts monthly, more casual dress from what was required previously…

Nothing I can do. Back to long god awful commutes, more money spent on gas, dry cleaning, less time to exercise because now I’m spending time inching along the freeway with all the other drones…

There has to be a better way…is this hell? Like, was I a pos in a past life and now I’m doomed to be an office drone in some shitty cubicle? Yeah I know it’s first world problems. I’ve been in third world countries and know there are millions of people who would love to take my cushy office job. I’m just here to bitch about it.

So when I was in the office, if I had a dr appt, I had to drive 45 minutes to the dr, near my home, see the dr, grab lunch and go back to work. Most days if it was going to be more than 3 hours, I just didn’t go in at all to avoid that much driving. Now I can go to the dr, and be back home to work, in 90 minutes or less. So less missed work for checkups,, lab work, etc. And I didn’t have to change drs that were closer to work for a job.

I got offered a position that is fully in office, but have been torn on taking it. I have been working from home for the last 5 years and I love the flexibility of wfh and I cannot stand commuting. Here’s the pros and cons with each company:

Company 1 (where I currently work):

Pros:

Fully remote

I have a good reputation here, get along well with most

Limited office politics since wfh

Good work/life balance

Manageable stress

Very stable job

Glassdoor rating is 4.7 out of 5

-Have animals that love me being home

Cons:

Lower range on salary for my field (I’ve had the only promotion you can get for my role, so maximum raise going forward is 3% each year)

-Boss is kind of weird and aggressive at times

I’m a mid level senior manager and there is no growth in site unless someone dies or retires (my peers have been in same position for over 13 years) realistically, I’m looking at 7-8 years in same position

Health benefits so-so

Limited diversity

Company 2-

Pros:

Great salary- I could make $50-$60k more annually (base salary) plus annual bonus.

Interesting field

Ability to learn a lot, autonomy to build out/restructure dept

Title I would want, if I stick it out for a year, it’ll set my path going forward for better salary and title.

Benefits covered 100%

Cons:

I found out the person before me was fired after 3 weeks, and found out in final interview 2 people have been fired for this role. (Hiring mgr shared they are fire happy)

-Major startup vibes

High turnover (although they say they are cleaning house for the better)

Glassdoor ratings are awful with it saying it’s a toxic environment- 2.5 out of 5

An hour commute there and back (2hrs)

Fully in office

It seems like it’ll be high stress

I’ve left a stable job for more money before and have been miserable, but it lead me to this job which I’m thankful for. There’s major red flags here, but I have the experience that’s needed to change some things and it could set me up exponentially for the future.

Thanks for the response everyone! To give some additional context- I make $100k, so this would be a 60% raise for me. I would use the extra money to pay off debt, and save for my own place. I currently rent an apartment with a roommate.

I live in CA where cost of living is extremely high. I’m not open to move, I love CA.

There would be a bump in title and money. I had to do some pre-work for the company as part of the interview process, and I actually know I can make new processes and new impactful changes, but the reviews and firing someone for 3 weeks makes me nervous.

I’ve worked for startups before, and built departments from scratch- but I know how extremely frustrating and inept people can be.

My company recently introduced a mandatory in-office day (Wednesday) for the whole company starting mid-July. Unfortunately, my team started this early, I’m assuming to set example and also because I fall under HR’s department. I am receiving emails that they want me to attend sales pitches for new software systems in-person and these are falling on WFH days (m,tu,th,f).

To anyone who has experienced this or has any thoughts, how do you navigate your team expecting you to attend in person meetings on your WFH days?

edit: thank you everyone for your ideas on navigation. already able to spearhead this and spoke with my boss and team mate. boss isn’t going in either and they had zero issues sending me a teams link. to all those who were kind, thank you. for all those who had negative criticism and critiques, try to be a little kinder and i wish you well. this is a sub ab wfh no? lol

I work for a company who has adopted a “hybrid” mandate to RTO at a previously wfh + as needed office visits environment.

For all of these companies inexplicably deciding that being in the office is absolutely necessary, yet even a year ago were beating the drums of “Covid is not joke - mask up, we’re in it together,”….do they not see that this is going to lead to a giant Covid outbreak again?

If they are just over it then why do any companies still adhere to the “quarantine if exposed” mentality?

Do you think that the RTO will be revisited?

I gotta share this with you guys lol
So during our daily meeting, one of my coworkers (who recently had a newborn) was holding his baby and we could see it in camera.
So me being a father of 2 kids (one of which is still a baby) I engaged him by saying: "Hey baby!".
My wife, while in the living room, sprinted to my office, and asked me: "Who the hell are you calling baby?!".
You can't make this stuff up 🤣

The title says it, we were forced to RTO due to better collaboration etc etc. The usual bs that everyone is spewing these days. What pissed me off is that now we have to do active shooter drills "to be prepared" in case of an emergency.

So you force everyone to return to the office and now everyone is pissed off and you are worrying about active shooters. Why couldn't we just stay WFH????

So last week, I had a beach vacation trip (still in the same country and time zone as my current job in the US) but since we rented a house, I was able to do work from home at the place since there was wifi.

My question is; if I were to take more vacations like this where I can still work (summer is ramping up!), Do/Should I tell my manager that I am technically somewhere else doing WFH?

Our company sent the RTO mandate today. After 3 years of a fully remote model, they’re requiring anyone within 50 miles of an office to go in every Monday & Tuesday.

They don’t even have enough space for the employees. They said the “IT team is working diligently to ensure there will be enough work spaces for the RTO deadline of September 18.”

They are literally putting “work spaces” on tall counters with metal barstools!

They’re also stated that “you can start your business day between 7-10am, but you must email your lead what shift you’re agreeing to for the rest of 2024 to hold yourself accountable.”

We’ve already had so many people quit recently. This year we lost our president, 3 VPs and 3 directors.

My position has been eliminated, and they’re currently trying to reallocate me to another department.

Fuck this. After 6 years with this company I’m out.

I got a job offer this week elsewhere at another company, it’s time to move on to better things.

I wonder how many people at my current company will quit after this.

I've been WFH for over 10+ years. During that time I heard it all from my friends..

"So, you just sit around playing video games all day"?

"When are you going to get a 'real job'?"

"So, let me get this straight...you pay for the electricity, internet, buy your own equipment, and use part of your home as an office? Man, they must be saving a fortune on chumps like you!".

3 years ago, those who were lucky enough to keep their jobs complained about having to do it remotely. Albeit temporarily. I saw MANY articles and social media posts complaining about how workers were now expected to keep up the same level of productivity at home...without the office. People were literally asking how long this would last and when they'd be able to get back to the office,

Then we did it. Productivity didn't suffer. People who had never worked remotely before, had an epiphany.

Now, in just 3 years, no one wants to go into the office for those “real jobs” anymore. Now all I see are complaints that the temp situation they knew was temp, is now over and the company expects RTO...like they told you they would do from the beginning.

People comparing that there aren't any WFH positions anymore.

Look, people have been working from home since the 90's. There have always been remote positions, its just that half the workforce wasn't looking for them. That wasn't considered a real job 4 years ago.

If your job wasn't remote before, it's unlikely it will all of a sudden be remote now. If you're in a profession that is typically not remote, it's unlikely to change soon.

From where I sit there are more remote jobs than ever, but competition for them is steep. Just as attitudes among workers have now changed about remote work, the other thing that has changed is you now have to compete for those positions.

A piece of paper with your work history is not the only consideration now. A piece of paper says you may be qualified to work in the office, You need to show employers that you are set up to work remotely, have the equipment and infrastructure needed to be productive, present well, and can work will little supervision and still get the job done.

They'll train you to do the job, they're not going to train you how to be a great remote worker too. They're not going to tell you, you look like crap, you sound like crap, your camera looks like it's shooting through a potato ,or watch you struggle with WiFi issues for a simple Zoom call. They don't want to hear whining about why you have to be on camera for a meeting.

They will expect that you're a work from home professional. If you're not, you're not getting that job.

Last thing...If you haven't changed to a field that has always had a lot of remote opportunities, or are still doing the same job as before 2020, you're likely going back to the office same as everyone else.

JMO of course

I was hired as an exec to work for a place several states away at the beginning of the pandemic, with a relocation agreement. Since then I have exceeded all metrics -- my organization has been chaotic, and had three top execs, one of which told me not to worry about relocating. My agreement lapsed, and they gave away my office. I do go in periodically, but more often I travel on their behalf, and it's cheaper from my actual home location. They also save beaucoup taxes on my employment, since I'm in a state where they require less payroll taxes.

So in January the newest exec was appointed over the second one, who had actually been running things for years for the first exec. It has been an unmitigated disaster. Immediately the new exec was blindsided with some regulatory issues that most of the company already knew about. We then reorganized -- I led my team through it, retaining almost everyone despite a lot of adverse situations. Overall we lost about a hundred people, and have been unable to do our jobs as usual for about 6 months now. Meanwhile in all this time there have been no raises, there were furloughs, and it's been an overall very frustrating situation. Right now despite being promised that we would be able to be more agile during the reorg, they're claiming I can't replace my only lost employee, even though the funding for her position comes from an external grant -- they don't even pay for it. Altogether, it's a pretty dissatisfying arrangement right now.

Anyway, my boss, who's between me and the top exec, decided that I need to RTO now. We had a meeting where he blindsided me with this, and with some complaints about employees in other divisions abusing the remote employee arrangement -- I told him that has nothing to do with me, and I actually am technically hybrid, so it's not even a comparable situation -- and he basically said that I agreed to move and now I need to. He used the phrase "let's be human about this."

I actually have no problem moving -- it's logistically difficult and we barely go into the office, even those who live right there, but I bought a house there when I was hired in anticipation of a move that now seems completely unnecessary so I'm actually kind of set up to do it successfully. With enough notice it's fine. There are even advantages. But it's not "human" to arbitrarily decide to make people work from an office where it's actually not necessary. Or, honestly, for a company that hasn't lived up to any of the promises that it made to me as an employee.

So...I'm spending this holiday weekend reaching out to my network and sending resumes out.

For me it would be all food/ snacks provided and a gas stipend.

My husband’s previous job had an on-site chef that provided breakfast, lunch and late day snacks. All cooked from scratch and would even take requests.

Even if they had a cafeteria and I got a monthly food allowance, I’d be there.

I work long hours, high pressure, etc. Average 10h a day, often more. It's just the shitty result of working in projects with high intensity short deadlines and being freelance. Time I rest is time I have to make up for later.

There are many days where I finish at night and all day I've only moved from my desk to the kitchen and to the bathroom. Needless to say this is very unhealthy.

How do you all beat this? Do you have any habits that fit into your routine? Especially if you also work long hours

For more than 15 years, many I know in the travel business have been dedicated WFH. No one raised an issue about the constant exchange of ideas and better communication and coordination. No one said shit about creativity, organizational culture-building, cross-functional collaboration other stupid phrases I have seen in constant emails. People applauded it because it saved the companies money.

I write this as my office has its nine thousandth covid wave.

I have been working at home full time since 2016 now am being told to RTO 4 days a week. This is one of the things I hate most about the pandemic is that no one ever questioned WFH in the past so critically at least at my employer and now you are literally punished and expected to suddenly uproot your entire life. I hate the thought of starting over but there is zero way I will ever do that.

.

Fortunately it’s only a few days a month, but I was told previously I was fine working from home but suddenly management cares for some reason even though my productivity has remained the same since March 2020.

Just wanted to come on here to complain and anyone else who’s recently gotten the RTO orders can complain here too.

I’m currently going through a UX design program so I plan to have a new job in the next few months, so I won’t be here much longer, but it’s still an annoying inconvenience to me.

I don’t have friends or family who really understand like other people who WFH (my wife tries her best for me) and I know it’s not a big deal, but it just feels disrespectful to my time as an adult that I’m being told I need to go into the office a couple times a month just to do what I do exactly the same from home…

Edit: It really is not a lot, and I know I sound like an ungrateful child complaining about it (when most of the world has to physically go to work every single day), but when you get your life used to never having to leave the house for work at all, and not having to spend the social energy to interact with coworkers all day, it’s a bit of a change.

Edit 2: I just want to clarify for any non-WFH people popping in here that my issue is not with the act of going into the office itself - my issue is being forced to go in for no reason after working just fine for over 3 years when my productivity is tracked the entire time regardless of where I am, so it’s visible to all management that my work is getting done.

I’ve been working from home since 2020 now. Last year I moved to a different job which is also WFH. These are standard 8-5 type jobs. The thing is, I’m a bit of a night owl. I’ll attend morning meetings but if I’m not in meetings I’ll be taking a nap or sleeping most of the morning.

I still get my work done, often times I’m up between 8pm-3am getting work done. Then I’m too tired to do work in the morning.

I can’t help but feel guilty about this though. Even though my work is getting done, I experience constant impostor syndrome and an irrational fear of getting caught.

If anyone’s in a similar boat, how do you deal with this?

I was offered a hybrid role and remote role within a couple of weeks of each other. While I know not everyone has the luxury of turning down a job, I feel like we should be telling these people outright any chance we get that we have no desire to be in a cubicle again and maybe it'll make a difference.

I just sent this to a company that offered me a hybrid position.

Hello BLANK
I regret to inform you that I have received an offer for another position. While I was excited to work for BLANK, I have opted for a fully remote opportunity. I would consider such a role in the future only if a fully remote option was available.
Thank you for your consideration.
MY NAME

So the big boss sent an email telling us we could have an "early dismissal" in anticipation of the 4th of July holiday. He said he "doesn't know what to call it now" since we are in a hybrid/remote work world now. I want to offer him some fun alternatives.

I was thinking "early offline" or "early logout/off." But I was hoping people had more catchy ideas.

[BTW, I think this points out subtle aggression against WFH, implying that we don't deserve an early dismissal because we are WFH. I work from home just as hard as when I work from the office, but my WFH is much more productive for me and the office.]

What do you think?

Been interviewing with the CEO of a company after a recruiter reached out to me about it.

I'm not desperate (luckily), I have a fully remote job now and am fine with it, but open to cool opportunities, and this is one.

The CEO really wants to hire a new leader to freshen up the company. My vision/skills/strengths align with exactly what he wants.

It's really that rare situation where I would bring a lot of value, and the job would also offer me career growth. The pay is right, etc.

I don't want to go into specifics, but it's a digital business and in the tech industry.

However, the CEO wants people going into the office 3x/week.

But GET THIS: Half the team is across the damn country from where I am, including himself (my prospective manager) and the person I'd be partnering with to run the whole thing.

One of my top capabilities is creating highly-collaborative work flows and environments, which they are currently lacking. I talked through the methods I use to run all kinds of workshops and how to create collaborative teams, and he loved it.

I am not sure if he understood that I've done all of that remotely. But he should since he knows that my job right now is remote, and that I work with people all over the world.

I haven't spoken with him directly about the remote vs. in-person thing, only through the recruiter. But it turns out they are having a hard time motivating people to come into the office, which is one thing they want this role to help do.

Honestly, I told the recruiter that there is no way for me to be that person. If they hired me, they would definitely see their company working more cohesively and collaboratively across teams, but the primary tools and methods I use are all digital. It would also be more difficult for me to jump from meeting to meeting with various people (many of whom are, again, an entire country away).

There is no way I can be the person who "gives people a reason to come into the office" when I have built most of my career remotely and rarely see a reason to work in-person.

Also, I would be managing and building a team. So, just an FYI for everyone, your CEOs may be deliberately not hiring leaders and managers who can lead remote-first teams. Even if they are a great fit.

I'm just now emerging into leadership-level roles that report directly to a CEO, and I guess it's just been super eye-opening to see how forced the RTO is first-hand. I wouldn't even be in the same office as him. They are literally trying to hire people who will *find* reasons to push their teams back into the office.

Yikes.

Honestly, I'll be glad to turn this down if this is the case. I'm going to keep interviewing though, just so that they really see my full potential before I turn it down. Hopefully it will be a reality check for them.

My office had a huge free gym attached to it, and I would go there before work to beat the dc commute traffic. Was in the best shape of my life because my commute was cut in half if I went to the gym.

Since Covid I’ve put on 40 pounds(hurts to say out loud lol). The past month I’ve been dieting successfully but only lost like 1-2 pounds. So I’ve stopped the gaining at least.

My problem is I’m just so stagnant most days. I bought some weights for home but really just have no motivation. Has anyone found a system that works? I also tried jogging but the road I live on is very busy, so I Dont really find it relaxing running through traffic jams

Documenting my experience. I went on-site to pick up my stuff and get through onboarding. It is mind blowing to me that I got stuck an hour in traffic each way, had to pay $16 parking (major city), and got a $10 lunch (I probably could’ve packed lunch. If I had to go everyday I would waste:

480 hours.

$3,840 in parking.

$960 in lunch if I only got lunch twice per week.
Why do big RTO expect us to get back in the office? It makes no sense.

How have you handled coworkers texting all hours of the day with both unimportant work stuff or personal stuff? They text as early as 6am and as late as 11pm. We only have personal phones. My phone won’t let me leave the group thread and although I mute it, I can’t see who texted and if it’s my boss so I end up reading it anyways. I’ve repeatedly told them for over a year that I don’t appreciate texts outside my work hours and they continue to do it but now they preface every unimportant text with “sorry for texting so late,” as if saying sorry is a good excuse to violating my boundaries. I’m unsure how to tell my boss that I don’t appreciate this or if I should get a Google voice number and make them only contact me on that instead. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Update : thanks everyone! I just sent an email to the boss telling him to change my number to a Google voice number and reminding him that this was a boundary I’ve been telling them about for a year that they keep violating. Unfortunately my job is govt grant funded so there is no work cell or landline I can use and I have senior, in poor health parents so the phone has to stay on. Hopefully google voice will work and if not, I’ll just block them all but the boss. 🙂

Hey guys,

So I work at a SaaS company as a Sales Development Rep. Our CEO stated several times last year we would only RTO “1-2 times a week max”.

Fast forward to today, they just informed me that they are uping the RTO to 4 days a week (Its 3 right now).

In order to be seen as “in office” you have to connect to the wifi in our office first login of the day. What I’ve been doing is signing in, working in office for maybe 2 hours, and then leaving and working the rest at home. I live maybe 5 minutes from our office so its not a big deal to me.

I am way more productive at home. I have 2 monitors here vs 1 there and quiet around me to make calls, plus better internet. The best part is our office is one of like 8 and they stopped hiring for our office because its so empty already. Its like a ghost town. I know absolutely zero people in my office because ive been remote for a long time.

I assume others do this too because i see them log in for our afternoon zoom meeting and their backdrop is their home offices. I dont know if they’ll ever pick up on this, but if they do and get upset i’d seriously look for another job because remote work is much better for me personally.

Anyone else do this or know of others who do this? I feel bad but at the same time i dont.

The all hands meeting introduced us to the concept of a hybrid model, and it left everyone scratching their heads in confusion. While others were confined to their homes during the pandemic, I mastered the art of working remotely with my trusty VPN, enjoying the freedom it brought. Our department, once a tight-knit local crew, has hired staff scattered across the country.

But now, with this hybrid model, my local office feels like a ghost town. Only two survivors remain, each working different shifts, resulting in just one person in the office at any given time. It's like a post-apocalyptic workplace, where we are the sole survivors of the great plague.

Retirement thoughts have started creeping into my mind, considering the logistical challenges that lie ahead. Juggling doggy daycare schedules, battling traffic nightmares, and enduring freezing office conditions that rival the chilling atmosphere of the Death Star.

But hey, at least I wouldn't be alone in this absurd adventure. My fellow colleague and I, operating on different shifts, are about to embark on the joyous journey of navigating an almost empty office. It's like a buddy cop comedy without the other cop.

So, as I muster up the courage to submit my exception request, I hope luck joins me as a faithful companion. Let's embrace the hilarity that awaits us in that deserted workplace, and may the comedy gods shower their whimsical blessings upon this journey. Break a leg, or rather, break the monotony! Figuratively, of course.

Wondering how many of you have a WFH position with camera on you and your keyboard the entire shift?

Is it not as weird as I feel it is?

Edit: Thank you everyone! Going to call this recruiter back and say thanks but no thanks!

Honestly just looking for some hopium. My work is trying to enforce RTO as of last month. We also got engagement survey last week and I expect many will bring up RTO as main issue. Are there any chances of them reverting their RTO stance?

Edit: I'm glad I asked. Reading your comments makes me feel better
More of a funny post than anything…

Just wondering how you would’ve handled it…

I manage a team of 22. Golf course crew. I am the superintendent.

One of my more senior guys (who is only 22) came in all distraught and pissy this morning. We start at 6:30am this time of year so I’m used to my guys being in grumpy tired moods in the morning. (Yes, my entire crew is guys. I had two young women on my crew earlier this year but one quit and one went back to school. It’s not by design I just never get a lot of female applicants. I pretty much hire any girl who applies though. They’re usually the best workers).

Anyway. He’s sitting there with his hood over his head not acknowledging me during our morning Meeting. He takes off to do his morning job and one of the other guys is finishing putting his boots on. I said “wow Ronnie is in a bad mood eh?” He says “yeah he left his vape under his pillow at home and he’s afraid his mom is gonna find it because she makes his bed”.

After I stopped laughing I remembered a time that my mom drove my truck and found a pack of cigarillos in the centre console. I only smoke them when I play golf, and even then maybe 1 per round. But moms are always gonna be moms. She said “well I’m not sure if I’m going to tell your dad about this but I’m very disappointed”.

I was 26. Twenty. Six. I’m 38 now and I still don’t want her to get mad at me.

So I found Ronnie on the course and told him he could go home if he wanted to find his vape and hide it before his mom found it. He declined at first…

10 mins later he bursts into the shop and says “okay I’m going home really quick to hide my vape. I’ll count this as my first break!”

I just thought it was a pretty funny situation. Wondering if anyone would’ve done it differently or if you’ve ever had anything like this happen.

Edit: thanks for all the love. I really wasn’t fishing for any pats on the back I just thought it was funny.

I do try to treat my staff with humanity. If there is something simple I can do to make work easier or more enjoyable I will almost always do it. This seemed like a no brainer. Appreciated the boost from y’all tho. I do sometimes question if I’m too nice sometimes since there are times when certain employees seem to take advantage of me. But for the most part I would rather show up to a workplace where I’m well liked and well respected than one where I’m feared but hated.

I had to terminate a sales person yesterday after 9 months of working with them and trying to get them to learn our sales methods, it’s never fun to let someone go. Afterwards I had our IT director give me access to their outlook account and was amazed at the number of sales this person had waiting in their email and didn’t close. For months we talked and coached about closing sales and learning our methods and it was like talking to a brick wall.

I had been second guessing myself for the last two weeks about letting this person go, I liked them and had work together before about 10 years ago. Finding all this maybe me realize it was the right call.

One of my staff called me and gave me his two weeks a while back. He was unable to work and do school at the same time. After talking a bit more I thanked him and said I'd see him tomorrow. He's like no I'm giving you my two weeks. I won't be in anymore. I'm like.. so you're just quitting without notice then. He's like NO you don't understand. I'm giving you my two weeks. I'm just like ok then.. just to confirm you're not working any of your shifts. He said yes because I'm giving you my two weeks and hung up..

New employee left some trash in the back, I told them that we have to throw it away. They quickly snapped and said “I’m in training” I replied that I understand that you are in training and I’m just letting you know that we throw away are trash not just leave it by the trash bin. 5 minutes later they came back crying and telling me l was disrespectful and rude, I told them that I am a manager and that I was telling them that we throw the trash away. They took it up the ladder to my boss and I had to write a statement of what happened along with theirs and another employee who witnessed what happened. Tomorrow it will be moved up to the general manager. I didn’t yell, raise my voice or use curse words. This was the new employees first day. Am I screwed? How do I handle a situation like this differently. All I wanted to do was inform them of our process.

I’ve newly joined a company as a manager and am struggling with a member in my team who I’m managing.

The team is currently going through training and he is not paying any attention and is instead distracting other team members. Today, I called him out in front of everyone and he didn’t like it.

Later in the day he kept distracting a team member who was trying to get through her training and I eventually had to interrupt and I overheard him tell another team member that I was a cockblock.

I feel like he has overstepped the line completely, and will be speaking to him on Monday. Any advice as to how to go about this?

If weaponized incompetence, inability to show up on time in appropriate clothing to save one's life and abusing PTO were Olympic sports, this woman would be a multiple gold medalist. She's also the type who CONSTANTLY makes dumb jokes and laughs at them herself.

I've been stuck with her because she's the close friend of one of the owners of the company. The owners are all extended family. There are 15 and only 4 actually work here and give a crap about the company and employees. The others just cash their checks and occasionally show up asking for annoying favors like, "Could you hire this rude idiot? She can't seem to keep a job. It should be fine."

I literally had to wait for the owner who brought her in to die to get the ok to fire her from my very nice, well-intentioned ass kisser of a boss. "We mustn't bother the family with this." Barf. He's retiring next year. I waited a week after the funeral to approach him about this. Brought in her MASSIVE personnel file. I've literally been documenting this employee's BS since my first day there. I made sure he wouldn't be able to turn me down in good conscience and it worked!

I've never seen my team happier on a Monday. We had a little celebratory pizza lunch to keep the good vibes going -- of course we didn't call it that, but everyone knew exactly what it was. I didn't even have to take over her work or split it up among my team members. They did it for me before I even had a chance to think about it. They even assigned me a task. 🤣 They're just happy that things will be done the right way.

This has been the best Monday in quite some time.

This happened a while ago but I always wondered what the right thing would have been.

My husband wanted to take me on a surprise trip to Paris. There was a deal that was no refundable. He wanted to make sure that I would be able to take the days off so he called my boss and asked her.

She told him it was fine, he booked it and I was thrilled with the surprise.

However! She called me into her office and told me how inappropriate it was and that no one should ever talk to her about my employment. She put it as a “strike” in my file.

I realize he could have surprised me without actually booking but there was a time limit on the deal and he was nervous I wouldn’t be able to ask her in time.

What would you think if this happened?

Edit: thanks for all of these opinions. It actually happened many moons ago but it came up again in a discussion of annoying managers. That job had many managers like this. It was very old school. Manager definitely didn’t have anyone whisking her away to Paris.

Edit: it seems it wasn’t clear that they knew each other. She was at our wedding and had met him multiple times.

How do you handle a workaholic team member who won’t respect their PTO?

I have a member of my team who is supposed to be out for the week recovering from an invasive surgery. I try to foster a sense of work/life balance and support on my team, however, she is a notorious workaholic who has a hard time trusting and letting go.

Myself and my other team member met with her ahead of time to get everything covered while she is out.

So tell me why I caught her sending emails quite literally just HOURS after her surgery? I have also caught her sending emails and trying to sneak into meetings all week. I have asked her to stop and prioritize rest. Told her everything is covered. She still won’t listen. I have literally gotten to the point of asking the entire team to remove her from meeting invites and email chains until her PTO is up. Today she tells me she is going to go ahead and lead 3 meetings because our stakeholder is going to be on vacation soon… I asked her to forward me the invite and let me lead BECAUSE SHE IS ON PTO. Then radio silence.

Not only is this frustrating because it sets an unhealthy precedent for my other team member who is a little more junior and impressionable and it also feels like she has no respect or trust in me and my leadership… but it is also dangerous. She has not been resting or taking care of her health this entire time… that scares me.

What do I do? Can I really even do anything?

UPDATE: Wow! This really blew up! Thank you for the great advice. Because she is now far enough along in her recovery that pain meds aren’t needed and she is on PTO not medical leave, I’m just going to let her be. While I would much rather have her focusing on rest, if she is dead-set on working I can’t do much to stop her. She is one of our strongest team members and is almost TOO good at her job. I don’t have worries about anything nefarious going on. I just know if I have surgery, my work laptop is going to be collecting dust; you won’t catch me sneaking into meetings!

I had an employee quit because they wanted more hours, gave them more hours, and then said they're quitting because they're working too many hours. What's your weirdest ones?

This week I'm sitting in on job interviews for a new starter, and some of the answers have been quite weird lol.

My question for hiring managers, what is the weirdest or funniest answer you have had in an interview?

The top 3 I've heard are:

3. "Why did you leave your previous job?" - Looks genuinely shocked "That's a very personal question"

2. "What is your biggest weakness?" - "A lot of my colleagues don't seem to like me, but the customers always do. I believe this is because the customers respect competence and this makes my colleagues jealous"

The undisputed best has to be:

"You said you see yourself working here for a long time. How high could you see yourself reaching here?"

"Erm...well I don't think I could reach very high...I'm only 4 foot 10"

I have an employee who has been absent for the past two weeks with medical issues. Seems their health has deteriorated over the past two weeks and they are now hospitalized. I care about them. They are a great coworker. However, I am unsure how much I should be in contact with them. They have messaged me to tell me that they are back in the hospital and not doing well. We spoke on the phone and they gave a bit more of an update. I am concerned because they live in a small city and they are at the small local hospital. When we spoke on the phone I told them that if they need me to pick them up and drive three hours to a world class hospital I have no problem doing that. I wanted to reiterate the fact that I would do that but:

They are an adult. They can make their own decisions. Maybe this is what they want.

I am their manager/coworker. I'm not family or even a best friend.

I don't want to bother...maybe I'm wrong and he's getting great care...No one likes to be bugged when they are sick.

Been a manager for just over a year and would love to hear what you seasoned managers would do.
Thank you.

Update: The doctors found out what is wrong and they are starting to recover. Thank you for all the comments and suggestions. I think it enforced that I did the right thing and reminded me that there will be a recovery period when the person comes back which I need to be helpful and understanding of. Thank you again!

Pretty much the title.

I’ll put mine in the comments.

I always have felt like most people don't, and only attend due to feeling obligated. My work has been having this discussion the past few years, and being in upper management I have to give my insight. From what it seems no one does (I don't) but the owner insists that they do. I think it's a kind gesture, but each year the room segregates into the typical workplace "cliques", and there is rarely any cross socialization. Also there tends to some "intoxicated" situations... which includes employees becoming very obnoxious and loud. But the problem is who the hell wants a "dry" XMAS party?
Anyways I wanted to get some opinions on the topic to see if maybe I am just delusional. I have talked off the hand to a few people, and they commented that they would rather simply have a bonus.

I'm curious to hear other managers tales of That Weird Interview!

Mine: standard phone screening, but the candidate keeps giving one word/phrase responses that they end by excitedly muttering "Jesus Christ...." and then long silence. A couple times I ask if they can elaborate, and they respond by saying the exact same thing. A couple times they say "hold on a second..." and then there is a long pause where they keep muttering to themselves. I wrap it up and thank them for their time, then ask if they have any questions... and they start interviewing me. I gave the same one-word replies.

My other favorite: TWICE had phone screens tell me to hang on a sec, then placed their drive through orders.

And one who crushed it all the way to the final round...where they manically shared an expletive-filled story about doing drugs with Grandma.

We have a new hire who is struggling with his job. He’s had 7 weeks of training but still require hand holding, and expects it. At this point, it’s clear he won’t succeed.

What’s your suggestion? help him succeed? Should he be let go? Every one of his answers is “okay, I get it”. Then calls to ask simple questions, doesn’t check references, or refer to guides. He also complains about every little thing that.

Edit: thanks for all the feedback everyone. The info you provided is valuable.

Edit 2: wow, I could write a whole book with all this info. I also wanted to add that I’m no micro manager but I expect staff to learn, and hold them selves accountable, some staff thinks I’m there to answer their phone calls all the time, some never calls, and I have some super stars. We had two very toxic employees that we kept way too long, and it became horrible. I’m definitely trying to avoid this situation with the new employee.

I don’t expect anyone to memorize everything overnight, but I expect everyone to be resourceful, and to take accountability for their work.

When I have an employee come to me with a complaint about another employee, I will listen patiently and ask some obvious and sometimes not so obvious questions. But when I know I’m getting a one-sided version of events, I will ask, “What will the other person say happened?” This always gets a deer in the headlights stare sometimes followed by stammering. Invariably I hear additional parts of the story, and sometimes I can even walk them off the ledge coming up with a mutually agreed to solution.

Ultimately the boss gives the rating the boss gives. The perception of people means more than anything you write. There are too many extraneous factors that influence your annual bonus and raise. The whole charade of writing reviews is such a waste of time!

I had to term an employee today that several of their co workers had complained about multiple times for being slow in their work and not doing things correctly.

I term them and now one of the people who complained about this former employee is posting on social media about how awesome the person was and how it's a shame that other people didn't see it (meaning me), and other employees liking the comment who have complained about her before.

What is happening?? Why are my employees now on this person's side? I'm a new manager so this is a bit confusing.

*Edit-

1: I didn't term this person BECAUSE several of their co workers complained. Yes, that was part of it but not all.
2: I investigated, I coached, I wrote corrective action, I gave 3rd chances, I documented complaints.
3: Since posting I have deleted my team from social media.

Long. Sorry.

I worked at a small-but-great company prior to covid, and loved it there but was paid junior wages (I was in my late 30s then, early 40s now). Finished my Master's at night, got an offer from a big organization to double up - went from $50k (sole breadwinner HCOL, that was really tough) to $100k. A couple promotions at big org and i doubled up again to 200k.

After 3 years, I was feeling burned out and got an offer to come back to small-but-great. Cool. Had candid talks with awesome CEO and came back. Was disappointed that he offered me 80k to come back, knowing I was making 200k, but again there were promises for big promotions, including becoming next in line as CEO. OK, I like the people and the company, I can work with that.

In the year I've been back, several folks have come to CEO asking for better wages. (Our cost of living increase 2023 vs 2019 is outrageous. Rents have doubled. Food has doubled.) He has not responded well. We lost some great talent and now we're shorthanded. One manager pulled me aside before leaving and said "You've left before, you understand. I thought I would retire here. But I can't afford to stay."

So after their departure, I get offered the mega promotion. It's 3 people's jobs combined, plus it's guaranteed-next-CEO. I'm thrilled. Then CEO calls me to temper expectations, yes it will be a lot of work but don't expect big money. Uhhh what??

I walk into our next meeting and CEO says "Figure out what number you need." I figure my best shot is full transparency, so I take out a piece of paper and write out my bills, and my current takehome, and point out that it doesn't add up, nor does it include student loans or a mortgage (i'm stuck renting because home prices skyrocketed along with interest rates). If they want me doing all those jobs I need to live close enough, so this is the problem we all need to solve together. I offer him my paper to take with him, he declines.

He has a series of board meetings, and even the head of the board sends me a "things are looking great, i can't see why this wouldn't work out" message. I am holding out hope he's right, but I'm starting to feel uneasy.

Next meeting, he says "So what's your number? what do you need?" I say "160k." He almost falls out of his chair. Apparently they were going to offer me 100k and thought it'd be fine. 100k doesn't even pay my current bills, and he knows it. It's also less than half what I gave up to come back, and he knows that too (I'm salaried here, no OT like at big org). WTF.

Chairman of the board calls me next to say that NOBODY - not CEO, not even himself - is making 160k here. WOW. Would've been nice to know that when I agreed to come back and take a cut from 200k. Apparently CEO didn't share that info with anyone else - and now I'm feeling taken for a ride. If he makes something in the low 100s, he KNEW i'd never make it back to 200 even if I took over as CEO. WTF again?

Chairman does a good job of coming back and resetting talks. How about for now, we shift your role to help with gaps, and we give you the bump we were planning (I guess that's the 100k, but i haven't heard that officially). I have some meetings to discuss new responsibilities, but CEO keeps avoiding having meetings about compensation. Start date for new role comes and goes, he's handing me things to do like I've been promoted, but we still haven't talked about compensation. He seems like he's just avoiding it because he knows it's going to be disappointing.

So last friday i called CEO and gave him my 2 weeks. He's floored. Blindsided. Super upset. Asked right away if I was going back to big org. I am. They offered me my old role, asked what number I wanted, I said "the same" and they literally replied "WOOHOO" and sent me the onboarding paperwork.

I'm sad. I wanted this to work out more than anyone! CEO was SUPER GREAT at managing the top levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs - he makes the team run well, takes the time to really understand what makes each one tick, rewards people constantly, praises people loudly, etc. But what an incredibly dropped ball to skip the base levels of the hierarchy.

In our negotiations I was super explicit about the stress of not being able to provide secure housing for my family because of rent increases and the ultra competitive housing market, and how that's the #1 problem for my family and how big a deal it was, and he shrugged it off. He has multiple homes. He has 6 luxury cars. He's constantly on little fun trips with his family. I can't do any of that, and I told him why, and he still can't believe I'd leave "over the money."

Edit:

Since these are the 2 things people are getting stuck on without reading the comments, some clarification:

CEO is wealthy, but not from this company. He doesn't need the salary here because he made crazy money at past companies, has side businesses, rental properties, and his spouse still makes ridiculous money.

The jump from 200k back down to 80k sounds horrible because I skipped a bunch of story about why I left 200k. It was a contractor position, not permanent, and I was having health problems from the high stress and OT hours (this was also during covid, which didn't help). They started cutting people on my team and then I was asked to take an unscheduled 4 month break, unpaid. I had lunch with CEO from my old company for fun, and it came up that he was hiring. When he told me I could come back onto CEO-track I was interested because he implied I could get back to around 200k. Obviously if I could get the same money in a permanent role, where I already know they like my work and want to keep me, and it's lower stress and better balance, I'm going to try for it. We all really liked each other!

The deal I came back to wasn't flat 80k, it was presented as around 110k with an 80k base, but wouldnt-ya-know-it a bunch of that stuff didn't materialize, so it ended up being 80k. If they'd presented it as 80 I would've declined. Also my spouse went back to work so we had a little bit of time for them to get this number back up - which is what we all thought was happening when they sprung the promotion offer recently.

And FWIW i'm going back to 200k because they offered me a longterm contract on a multiyear project with better balance than my previous assignment, so I am walking in with my health and work-life balance very much in mind. I am very much looking forward to returning.

I work remote and so do all my employees. I got a new treadmill towards the beginning of the year and so did several folks on my team. I thought it would be awesome to do a treadmill walk and work session where we all logged in shared ourselves on camera while we walked and worked. You know exercise team building all of that fun stuff.

Apparently I was getting a little too confident in my abilities to multitask and decided to pick up my coffee cup. I got off kilter stepped on the side of the treadmill. I lost my balance and hit the floor pretty hard. My coffee cup flew up in the air and quickly smashed on the tile floor next to me. I was covere in coffee with a bruised ego lol. I was so embarrassed! I quickly popped up, stuck my face really close to my camera and said "Oh my gosh. I'm okay, maybe!" and then disappeared again. While off screen, I was scrambling to find the camera off button while mumbling explanations mostly to myself. Everyone still has a good laugh about it today! And no, we weren't recording the session, thank goodness for minor miracles.

There has never been a walk/work session again.

*edit spelling

Our organization recently hired a project manager and assigned him to my team. The man however routinely smells of alcohol, frequently staggers when he walks, and sometimes his hands shakes so violently he’s unable to take meeting notes. He also is not at his desk working when he should be and falsifies his timesheet. He’s fallen asleep at his desk. This is all in the first two weeks of employment.

My supervisor (the division manager) and his supervisor (the department manager) have warned me repeatedly to not follow the standard procedure established by the HR office. Instead I need to “make this work” and to not put any of this behavior in writing because of liability and accountability.

Talking with my coworker about something her team member said in a public training to a vendor, we realized there are so many things we never thought we would have to say to our direct reports, but somehow have to.

Prime example: (we are in social services) You should not interrupt someone sharing about their family member who died to ask them why they never responded to your email. In front of all the participants. 😑🤦🏼‍♀️

I’m sure you all have some good ones!

Need some perspective on time worked during the workday. About 8 months ago, I hired a new team member. We made an offer the day after the first interview, she accepted the next day and started one week later. The week she started, she told me she was four months pregnant and would be needing maternity leave. We have an “marginal” maternity leave policy, so she had six weeks fully paid by the company, and after that she took sick time and vacation time, resulting in her being off for about 10 weeks total. Now that she’s returned, she’s using the Mothers’ Room to pump three times per day for 30 minutes per time. She’s also training for a race, so she takes a 90-minute lunch. This results in her working about 6 hours per day. She generally doesn’t stay late to make up any time (salaried position) so it’s resulting in a 30 hour workweek. My question to other users is how you classify pumping time in the workday, or is this even a thing that’s tracked, or should be. She is a single parent, so she doesn’t have anyone else to pick up the baby after work and doesn’t log in from home. Thoughts?

I recently inherited an employee with 20+ years tenure at the organization. He is a smart, driven, friendly individual. In 20 years he has accrued responsibility for a number of critical projects (think core financial reporting) and is often working evenings and weekends to meet expectations. This is obviously not sustainable.

When offered help in the way of additional headcount he refuses, saying training would take more time, it requires too much experience to delegate to a new hire, etc.

Obviously redistributing the work needs to happen in case he quits, but if I push him on this he’s likely to leave since he has no interest in mentoring or managing others. At which point we have no way to train new staff.

Any thoughts? It feels like a damned if you do, damned if you don’t scenario.

14 months ago, I was one of the first 50 employees at a start up that’s now grown to nearly 200 across a couple of states. For months I worked 50-60 hour weeks, sacrificing a lot to help build a successful team.

Three months ago my boss was promoted to an SVP position (well deserved because he busts his ass for the company). Shortly after he said that he requested a promotion for me and all of his direct reports. One of his direct reports got a promotion. Then I was told our entire company was undergoing a reorganization that has yet to be announced.

I don’t mind not getting a promotion if it was never a carrot dangled in front of me. However I caught wind that the reorg will be announced soon.

Would you consider leaving a company if you were passed over for a promotion that was promised to you for months?

EDIT: After months of exhaustion, I started looking at other options and now have a job offer in hand literally hours after learning that the restructure is happening VERY soon. Trying to decide do I bide my time and tap dance around while seeing if my current employer fails to carry through on what feels like a promised promotion.

ANOTHER EDIT: After some of the comments in this thread, I started getting paranoid about a lay off so I emailed HR telling them the situation about what my boss had told me re: the promotion request, the solo person who did get promoted, concerns that we don’t have a formal review process.

I basically said (in a professional way): “There has been talk about a reorg and I understand if you can’t tell me, but are there plans for layoffs? And do we have plans for a formal review process because I can only assume I’m doing a satisfactory job based on what my boss says?”

I have since recalled the email and plan to talk to my boss directly on Monday. It’s become painfully clear that I’m totally burnout and either need a long vacation or a new job.

As a mid-level manager, I look out across my organization and see two types of managers: those who can work in the weeds so to speak when needed, and those who exclusively “manage”. As one of the former, I can’t help but feel a bit of disdain for the latter, like you don’t really deserve to manage someone if you can’t fill in for them for a day. But I also understand that managing people is a skill in of itself, and some people are probably great at it without doing what their employees do (coaches of team sports come to mind).

My boss, a VP, absolutely cannot do what I do, nor does he manage me in any positive way that I can identify, so I’m left wondering how he feels satisfied at the end of the day.

Today was the holiday luncheon at the warehouse I work at. I have 11 reports in my department and 3 were out today for personal reasons. Of the remaining 8, 1 just flat out refused to go up to the luncheon and stayed in the department. The other 7 were transported up front for the meal. When I finally finished transporting my people up front, I looked around and my entire team was no where to be seen.

They all decided to leave the building and do their own thing for lunch instead of staying for free food and to socialize with their peers.

I don't know what to think or how to feel about this.

One of my employees gave their 2 weeks notice today and when I advised them that they are still going to be working the notice period (we are incredibly short staffed) they acted surprised and said that they assumed they would be walked out.

Now this employee is not going to a competitor and we are very short staffed and I am worried that they are going to either be malicious compliant and do minimal work (or even sabotage) but upper management is clear that we cannot afford to lose more people especially as we are entering Q4 which is our busiest quarter.

Not really sure how to handle this...if their performance slacks can I refer to the conversation we had where they acted surprised (and a little upset) that they wouldn't be walked out with 2 weeks pay upfront for no work?

edit: Not in the USA folks, we cannot just accept their resignation effective immediately (not without paying out the notice).

I have someone on my team who just doesn't care. I don't want to have him fired because otherwise he is very good at what he does, and he does essential work. Also he's a good guy but that probably shouldn't factor in this. Problem is he just doesn't care. I can't trust him with essential tasks any more because they are all late or half done submitted at the last possible second or hours after EOD, leaving me impossible to give feedback because the work just needs to be handed in to the client at that point. Every task is delayed, I have to chase him constantly to keep him on track, etc. His workload very manageable and I also never force a deadline on anyone. I always ask them to set a deadline, and put an extra one or two days on the internal calendar as a safety buffer. But he manages to miss even those. Because he was sick, his dog was sick, he was busy with something else, family issues etc. endless string of excuses that at this point became very transparent as invented excuses. I try my best to help he and everyone else on my team as much as possible to enable them where I can, and I just can't find it reasonable that I should be breathing down on people's neck constantly and mentally whipping them to get shit done. Somehow I got this idealistic mindset that people should be responsible about their work without me forcing them into it, and at this point I don't think its a realistic approach.

So this person interviewed well. Everyone on your staff is acquainted with this person and seems like a good fit. You hire this person and on the second week you are told by most of your staff, they are uncomfortable with the new hire. The new hire has inappropriate conversations about their bowel movements and their lifestyle. A few times these conversations were said in front of customers. Even said the C word on the floor and there may or may not have been in the store. The person is very touchy and preformed some unsolicited actions toward one staff member that most would considered to be sexual harassment.

Would you give this new hire a warning and hope they will change their tune? Or would you fire them immediately?

Well, I fired them immediately. But I’m hearing on the grape vine the person is texting my staff saying they should have been warned first. Also felt like they were friends with everyone and said those who felt uncomfortable should have said something to them and now they are embarrassed.

Now, I’m questioning my decision and feeling bad about all this. However I’m 100% confident this person wasn’t going to change and prolong the agony. Plus what message would I give to the rest of my staff if I had given this person a second chance?

Edit: Wow, I wasn’t expecting this many comments. Thank you for your feedback. To answer your questions. I manage a small independent retail store that caters to the creative community. We are an “ At will “ state and when I fired the person I kept it short and simple. I did not go into detail not only to protect my staff but the company as well. Also, I documented everything. Yes we have a 90 day probation policy and the hire was made aware of that. This was not their first job and yes I googled them and checked their references. However, in my state previous employers legally can only state the potential hire worked for them. Yes we have an employee handbook. Mind you we even have a sexual harassment clause posted in our break room.

To answer the comments about asking the right questions during the interview: I have a extensive questionnaire to get a sense on their knowledge in the field, there experience with customer service, critical thinking and personality.

Lastly, my decision was not based on hearsay. I had multiple witnesses including my assistant manager. Without going into detail about the sexual harassment I was an ear shot away from the moment in question and knew the where-a-bouts of the people involved. I too had an experience. The new hire thought it was acceptable to tell me they had to go take a poop and and I immediately told them that was too much information and it seemed like they thought I was joking along with them. They also have attempted to touch me during our many interactions. We also have video recording throughout the day all over the store so some of the complaints were backed up by video. After all the TMI stuff I witnessed and heard I was planning on having a sit down with this person and give them a warning however this all happened so quickly and just before I was about to have a talk I got wind of the sexual harassment. If that had not happened It would have been a warning.

My assistant. Great guy. But he launches into these extremely specific, highly detailed explanations once he finishes completing a task that I assign him.

Today, I finally stopped him. "I just want a turkey sandwich. I don't care if the lettuce is romaine or iceberg. I don't care if the mustard is spicy or sweet. Is it a turkey sandwich?"

He replied "it's a turkey sandwich".

I hope it's clicked with him.

EDIT: First thing this morning, I explained to him that I trust him. And thar when a task is assigned and completed, a simple "I'm done" is all that's necessary. And that if certain challenges popped up that made the task more difficult than it should have been or prevented him from completing the task, then we can go into detail.

It's actually an assistant manager. Last year he went hunting, and when he got back I overheard him telling another coworker how he shot a mama elk in front of her baby. I do not hunt. But according to what I've been told by other hunters, while not illegal, this is unethical.

Every time I thought about this, I got angry. I've also heard him bragging about how he and his hunting buddy, once the hunting trip is over, will shoot everything they see indiscriminately on the way back.

So this year, he went on his annual hunting trip, and he came back last week, and again telling his hunting stories. I said, so did you kill a mama in front of her baby again this year? He didn't like that. But, honestly, I have been waiting all year to do it.

About an hour later, I was called into the office. The general manager and assistant manager in question was there. The manager said I had no right to embarrass Steve in front of his coworkers, and when I said he should be embarrassed, the discussion went South from there.

This happened on Friday. So I don't know what Monday's going to bring. But I said my peace. I feel I had every right to say what I said.

I manage 4 teams of people in healthcare.

One group of check-in staff. Pretty self sufficient. Lowest wages, so I can't add work to their plate.

One group of registration staff. It's an in-person job, requiring 3 FTE to keep up. I have 2. Both are quarantined with Covid right now.

Switchboard (telephone operators). They manage around 500 calls per day. It takes 2 people on average. Both of my people have FMLA. It's a 50/50 on if either show up to work.

A group of administrators who run the hospital 24/7. The handle any patient transfers in/out of the facility. They run the Emergency Department. They handle patient deaths and paperwork with family. It takes 2 to do the job during business hours. Just 1 at all other times. I'm allowed 8, but currently am down to 3 thanks to hiring delays. In 9 months, we've only onboarded 2 people, while losing 4. It's not for a lack of applicants, just a lack of action from HR staff. In absence of positions 2 or 3, their work rolls to this 4th group, worsening burnout. Try running an emergency department and taking calls from ambulances/other hospitals with 500 extra calls from patients asking when their appointment is... This position also suffered a reduction in base salary 2-3 years ago, which raised turnover from 12.4% to 47.5%. This is finally being reversed, but the position has lost all appeal within the organization. If one of these people get Covid, we have no options.

If you did the math, you know that 24/7 coverage isn't possible with 3 FTE, so I'm covering full-time and picking up every call-out. This means my other teams are neglected.

I've begged leadership to expedite hiring, grant retention bonuses, anything. I got my hand slapped for emailing HR leadership to ask about to delays, pointing out that they are out of compliance with policy. I'm averaging 55 hour weeks with at least one being on night shift. Haven't had a weekend or holiday off in months. My boss keeps volunteering my staff for non-essential outreach events. My staff have all been on mandatory over-time since January and can't take on these events, so they're falling to me too.

Personally, my mental health is suffering. Unfortunately, this hospital is also my primary source of healthcare. And my employees have eyes everywhere. The last time I walked over to our Mental Health clinic, I had 3 different employees mention it to me, all with their own narrative.

At this point, I feel like I've been postponing a train crash for months, so leaders don't have to see the consequence of their inaction. I'm thinking the most rational idea is to leave and let it all finally fail.

Edit: Forgot to mention, for a cherry on top, they took away my private office. It wasn't much, but now I'll be sharing with another supervisor. Meanwhile, a nonsupervisory person will be taking my office. Too bad for any employees who wanted a private conversation I guess. Am I wrong for considering a private office a part of the compensation package?

First time manager here. I received very little training before accepting this job. It was a direct promotion from IC to manager here.

So my boss really has it out for a guy on the team. The team member is Jewish and has complained about being intentionally ostracized.

I don't like the idea that I'm being asked to do this because he's always making me look good and having one success after another. He communicates well and keeps me updated on things I'd never dream of figuring out. He mentors the team, and tries to include others to make them successful as well, but my boss just hates his guts and keeps ranting about him being a Mossad spy.

I've reported that to HR, and they brushed it off.

Now because I've been asked to do this, I have no choice if I want to keep my job. I've tried but I find it impossible to manage him out because he keeps working around me.

He's asked me what's expected of him, and I'm not able to give him an answer. I'm only told to ask about his projects in flight so we can start shutting them down, or passing them to someone else. Our team hasn't done anything useful in months, and he's been solving a lot of problems in the mean time... but he has to go find these problems himself.

We've tried taking away his projects, but he just creates new ones that are surprisingly good. It's gotten to the point where my boss has gotten involved in directly shutting down those projects and putting them on hold.

My contractors unfortunately have no idea what they're doing. They can't write code, and keep copy and pasting snippets or trying to get ChatGPT to write it for them, and they have no idea why it doesn't work. But the management is fine with this.

I feel like I'm in the dark about impending layoffs. I can't find a single fault in his work, and he doesn't cause trouble. They can't fire him because he's made a claim about being discriminated against, and honestly he has been... WTF is going on, and what do I do? I'm already interviewing, but in the mean time...?

Industry: Media

Field: Cyber Security.

I’m joking of course. But man I wish I could xD I can’t stand a bad attitude every shift they work. It got old about 8 verbal warnings ago.

so I had a manager ask me if I can add him first before anyone on his team in any emails I send to his team and mentioned proper etiquette is to add users in order based on seniority. Usually I do it in a random order of whatever names I can think of first and in the last email I sent he was last contact in the send list. He asked very nicely but as a manager at his same level, I am shocked it bothered him enough to ask me to do this.

Im just curious, is this really a thing?

One of my best employees quit last week and gave us approx a 2 month notice. But since their notice they are doing little work (think maybe 10 emails a day instead of their usual 60). So not enough to get fired for job abandonment but enough to lose a few accounts and just generally cause me more work and headaches...

Whats really disappointing is that this is in Canada so I cannot just accept their resignation immediately (would be considered firing without cause and they would be able to apply for EI and potentially sue).

Our dept is extremely short staffed so I cant just walk them out and pay out the notice period so Im wondering how do I motivate them so they dont tank our dept?

Am I just SOL until their notice is done? Idk why they gave such a long notice but they are firm in leaving (new role is in a diff industry and allegedly pays triple our base pay...)

EDIT: okokok I get it. Clearly Im stuck and can't do anything. We will ride out the remaining notice period. Please stop harassing me in my DMs. I am MIDDLE MANAGEMENT literally only 1 step above this employee, I barely make more than they do and I am not in charge of salaries. We are not some multi billion dollar corporation we're a small sized family owned company so we are at mercy at the market rates. You all need to touch grass and remmeber that some of us actually take pride in doing our jobs...

One of the people I manage is paid well above average yet lives paycheck to paycheck and often can't pay his bills. He has 3 kids and a wife who doesn't work. Multiple times every month he contacts me asking for his paycheck early or a loan or help paying his car repair bill. We've already given him a 25% raise and an advance which is equal to 2x his regular paycheck. I don't think it would be wise to advance him any more money but I feel sorry for him and his constant requests are getting annoying.

When I approved the salary advance a few months ago he was extremely grateful and happy, but now his attitude has turned noticeably agitated and sour after I turned down his request for a second advance (he hasn't even paid back one tenth of the first advance yet).

What would be the best way to deal with this?

Hey everyone! I work for a company who deals in remediations around 8/2023 the company started deleting employees from group and work chats while they where on the clock! This caused employees to yell at me (I'm a lead who started on 2023) They wanted to know why they got let go with zero notice. No one was informed they where being let go. (This company hires thru agencies all employees let go where thru agencies. I was hired thru an agency as a lead.) The next day I got called into office and was told I am now no longer a lead but I can keep the pay and I have to WFH. If I can't work from home I'd be terminated. This job mentioned nothing about WFH at any time I was also hired as a tactical team lead which is not what I am doing or officially hired for. I want to know if the company can just demote and fire as they please. I signed thru the agency as a lead making a certain amount don't they have to keep up their end of the deal since it's thru an agency and it's a signed work agreement?

I have been a manager for sometime now and I had baby whom I absolutely adore. Ever since I’ve been back at work from mat leave I can’t stand it, I feel like I deal with an actual baby now so trying to deal with adult babies is so hard, I can’t find myself being able to empathize with them anymore or even find validity in any of their concerns or complaints. Everything they bicker about or complain about gets on my nerves even more because it’s like, yall are grown people why do you complain about the smallest things. Idk maybe i’m being dramatic. Also I just want to stay at home with my baby.

My company hired a gal back in 2020 ish basically begging for the job. The first few months were ok. I was her manager and I nearly quit my job of 12 years because of her. She would constantly refuse to perform work tasks she was given, lie, eff around on social media instead of working. I got to the point I had to take pics of our conversations because she was lying to our boss about what was being said. She considered being assigned work tasks bullying. It was the craziest thing I’d ever experienced. She was o lay two years younger than myself (35 at the time). She took a “mental health” leave due to this apparent toxic workplace and basically told my employer that they were going to lay her off etc etc. it was astonishing. Over a year later and she still leaves reviews that just aren’t true. I just needed to vent because it’s just not fair that one persons lies about a workplace can affect it in the future (we are a very small company and most staff has been here for 8 plus years). I’ve never experienced that sort of entitlement before and the extent of lies to get her way. It was crazy.

I've been training someone for 4 months and during this time I've noticed that she finds instructional videos and written instructions from me and Google searches confusing and/or unclear. I have a lot of responsibility in the office so I don't always have time to carve out 1-3 hours to go over something or review something. I created videos as a resource for her to review.

Ultimately, I find myself using my own instructions to walk through tasks with her and she rewrites the instructions for herself.

We use Gusto for payroll, etc., and recently she needed to change some info on her tax forms. I reach out to Gusto for assistance and they sent me back a link with instructions from their FAQ database and along with a video. I sent all of this to her. Her response was "I read through the instructions and they were not very clear." I read through the instructions as well, followed the instructions and it was pretty easy to figure out.

Unfortunately, there are other areas that she thinks are confusing and unclear as well. I've created 2-3 calendars explaining due dates/deadlines, walked her through excel basics for nearly 30 days (to the best of my ability). I've had to start creating a daily agenda for her because she was spending 3-6 hours on 2 reports and she wasn't completing other tasks.

Sorry, this turned into a rant. It is frustrating because her resume seemed impressive and she's well-spoken and communicates well with customers. However, she talks as if tasks are being completed and they aren't.

I can't figure out if I'm not being clear enough in my communication or if she actually doesn't have the skills to comprehend.

Any advice would be great.

All the advice has been great and wanted to add more insight or answer some of the comments. She's an native English speaker and is in her early 30s, like me. I see where I've got to change some of my behaviors either make her successful or look for someone else who would be a better fit.

A few comments stated that I haven't always been clear in my communication and that I need to stop hand holding and doing the work for her, and agendas are too far. I agree 100%

A handful of comments mentioned learning disabilities, I'm not going to ask her to about that and I'm not sure if she is even aware of it. There was a moment about a month ago, I asked her to buy a canister of sugar for the coffee area on the kitchen. She came back with Sweet N' Low and confidently handed it to me as sugar. I was so confused, but I'm not satisfied ng anything about it.

I'll admit that my videos and written instructions aren't always clear, however she finds instructions from Gusto's, and Ring Central's FAQ section confusing as well.

Regarding her "impressive" resume, she used to work for a mortgage company in the underwriting department and it's fast paced, long hours, heavy work loads, etc. She also runs her own photography business. So I had no reason to doubt her skill set until about month in.

I have tried to "do less" last month and I noticed that she was taking too much time to complete 2 reports. These are the 1st two reports she learned to do. Instead of meeting the 2 hour deadline, she was taking 6-8 hours. The team leads need those reports asap. She was also a bit combative when I reinforced the deadline. I didn't want to fight, so the team leads gave her a deadline instead.

I'm the only one in my department and there isn't anyone else who can train her.

I know that I have 4-5 years excel experience on her but I can't train her well enough on the basics. All my knowledge is trial and error and Google. I told her to find a beginners course. She's going to complete and hopefully that helps her. I am just baffled that she doesn't use Google to find a solution, there are so many resources there.

She's great at party planning, creating flyers, announcement bulletins, buying snacks for the kitchen and other "fun" things. But that's only 25% - 30% of the job, most of the job is tracking production, metrics, etc.

I am down to my last two tasks she needs to learn, which I'll be covering tomorrow. I'm going to review tasks moving forward and I am going to ask what she prefers for a learning style and go from there.

Thanks everyone.

I have a worker who is not completing her tasks on time, and refusing to accept new tasks given to her, and keeps saying she is overwhelmed. Always behind, calling in sick often, and very dismissive when I question her. Last week I sat down with this person to discuss her work performance, and find eventual solutions, but she won’t let me talk, screamed at me several times that I am not supporting her and don’t treat her right, but could not explain why she says that. Finally she screamed at me that I am the reason she is now getting psychiatric treatment. I was not aware of this. She also said “You are hurting me!!” and at that point I ended the meeting, and asked for the HR to step in.

What should I do if accused like this?

Thanks.

An employee has requested that they be excluded from my occasional emails to the team because “they already know what to do”. Obviously there are issues with the group not accomplishing certain tasks that they should know to do, but are not sufficiently on top of. Employee feels it demeaning to take directives from me- I am younger and newer to the company. To my knowledge she is the only one to complain, and I do try to step outside myself and envision from other points of view as I know she is sensitive.

Any suggestions on dealing with this increasingly difficult employee? I have already done so much for her- 25% raise while decreasing her workload by nearly half, encouraged her to seek accommodation letter to get her set up with accommodations- 1 day work from home and additional flexibilities. Stopped having weekly meetings because she didn’t want to have to attend… stopped team lunch outings because she didn’t want to have to attend… stopped wearing perfume, scented lotions, scented deodorant because she complained although doesn’t complain when other people wear it….

Meanwhile her work output is going downhill and causing me to stay late mopping up her mistakes.

I'm a GM, and I have a couple assistant managers who are new to management. We have a meeting coming up and I want to give them some advice. I obviously have a few things myself but I'm always open to more ideas!

For context, this is a small local business, 11 employees including me. But share your advice for any type of workplace!

I assume it’s not just us?

I work in Healthcare, at a hospital. It seems we float the line of being unethical in various areas of practice and illegal. My question is, what is the most illegal/unethical thing you've seen your company do?

Instead…disgruntled people looking to project their experiences on others?

I made a thread..out of genuine concern for one of my employees. The one about bitching and negativity. Looking for answers… as a good manager cares about their worker’s well being.

Tha’ts is…no other motivation. Hoping I could effect an employee in a positive way

So, reading back today…Revisiting the many good posts…I noticed like 30% were flat out nasty. I was accused of dumping all of my work on her, being lazy, not liking her….threatened that she’ll ‘take my job’ and several other ridiculous things😂 All of this is so far from the truth it makes me wonder. Are people just posting here to work through their own personal grudges? I mean, this sub forum would be a good place to attack managers, if you happen to hate them in general lol

Thoughts?

Hello,I manage a small team in a growing tech company. One team member, who is very skilled, seems to have a problem with me. She is friendly and helpful to everyone else but acts differently with me. When I ask her questions, she gives me short and quick answers. This is confusing because everyone likes her in the company, and I also think I am highly liked (I have relations that go beyond work with many coworkers)We talk every week, and I always ask how she is and if she has any thoughts or feedback for me. She never shares any problems and says everything is fine. But, from our daily talks, I feel everything is not fine.I know we can’t be friends with everyone at work, but this situation is making my job hard. This is really taking my energy down. I’m thinking about asking her directly if she has a problem with me and how we can make things better.Any advice or thoughts on this would be really helpful. How can we fix our work relationship?

Edit 1: Thank you so much for all your insightful responses; they’ve been incredibly helpful. Since responding to each message individually is difficult, I’ll attempt to summarize the collective advice here. The prevalent recommendation seems to be that I should take a step back and strive to emotionally detach from the job, which is challenging given the close knit between my social and professional lives. The consensus is that as long as the relationship with my coworker remains professional, it’s wiser to accept the current state of affairs rather than pressing too hard for changes.

Edit 2: I see many comments revolving around me trying to be friends with my reports. Maybe this was not clear enough in the original post, but what I am looking for is rather a work relation where we can collaborate in a relax and enjoyable atmosphere. I don't want us to become best friends for ever, but I am now in a situation where my report seems upset whenever I ask her a question, and the rest of the team also feels that it is always tense during meetings - which is not ideal.

I work in the logistics and supply chain industry with a background in large scale for fulfillment center management. When I first joined my organization, nearly 7 years ago, things were a mess. I replaced the existing GM about a year after I was hired and while things were chaotic the first year, I ultimately streamlined a lot of the processes, cut the negative or non producing staff and created a KPI dashboards to help track efficiency. The last two years my facility has basically run on auto pilot. I’ve built an incredible team and everyone gets along well which I’m grateful for but the last 18 months or so I find myself incredibly bored with nothing to do. Our company continues to grow at 10 to 15% and my facility is the top performer both on volume and gross margin.

I was offered a position at a competitor, lower pay(15% less) but more opportunities for career advancement. A mentor of mine told me I would be crazy to leave this job because of the work life balance it provides plus I don’t really have any stress. I’m married with 3 kids and I’m very involved as I’m home by 4PM everyday. I just can’t help but feel like I’m wasting my talent here but at the same time, I like the flexibility and lucrative salary my job provides me.

I mentioned how I felt to a colleague of mine, and he told me he was in a similar place when he was my age. He worked for a large pharmaceutical company and he basically coasted for 15 years with a high paying job with very little stress, but very little career advancement. For him, the titles or career advancement/challenge didn’t matter at all because being present was most important.

Anyone else feel that they’ve given up more challenging opportunities to kind of coast through?

I currently manage one of the largest teams of any manager in my division, doing extremely critical work that funds the entire organization. There is no one at my level who manages a team half as large as mine, especially not doing business-critical work. I have received consistently stellar performance ratings and top-tier 360 evaluation scores. All of my day to day peers are senior to me in title and make substantially more money. People routinely tell me that it’s clear I am performing (and expected to perform) beyond my current title and pay band.

But a promotion would put me at the same level as my manager and I have been told that’s currently a no-go, even though there are several examples of same-level reporting (including someone at my level who reports to me). She is not up for a promotion and the timeline on which she would be is tenuous. They (her boss and HR) keep saying that they’re “evaluating the situation holistically” and that they’re confident they can make something work on some unspecified timeline. I am tired of waiting. I just extended offers to two new team members and will now manage a larger, more cross-functional team than anyone other than my own boss, and she only has me “beat” because my direct reports count in her org chart. It’s total bullshit.

I am tempted to threaten to quit if they don’t promote me on a specified timeline. My husband can support our family on his salary alone - nearly 100% of my paycheck goes to childcare - and I’ve been thinking maybe a few years as a SAHM would be ideal. I’ll start applying for other jobs too, but the market is rough right now and my industry is somewhat small and specialized.

My question: have you or any of your direct reports ever extorted a promotion with a threat to quit? How did it turn out for you / them?

After reading this thread for a couple months, I've noticed a common scenario.

Its usually, "XYZ employee is competent, is efficient, and performs work at an adequate level of quality but they.........

The "but" is some silly reason like they are 10 mins late each day, they listen to music at work, they read the news on company time, they wear tennis shoes instead of clogs, they squint when they talk to me ect....

Is there anyone out there along the lines of the ends justifies the means? Micromanaging, especially skilled professionals, seem ridiculous. Looking for others viewpoints.

My manager almost 15 years ago was so chill I literally emulate him on the daily. One of the first things he said was that my family is first and job is second. He always delegated things to me and said his job is to remove my obstacles. If anyone tried to bypass me and go to him directly he would just send them back to me.

He’s been at the same level for 15 yrs and always said he’s great at middle management and has no desire to go up. It’s not worth it. He was truly an amazing manager.

I have a staff of ~15 engineers of all stages in their careers from just out of college to ready to retire. My company has a bit of a farce of a performance review cycle, and the smarter employees understand what happens.

To set the stage, I work at a very large technology corporation. We used to do performance reviews and ranked everyone top to bottom. With the top ~20% getting the best raises and bonuses the next year, then goes down from there. Nobody was denied a raise as long as they didn't get marked as poorly performing, which is pretty rare. Anyway a couple of years ago they decided to do away with that ranking system and set it so everyone gets the same raise, and the same % bonus. Then the top 20% of performers get a little boost on top of that.

That's bad enough from a "pay for performance" motivation standpoint, since now everyone knows that they are all lumped in the same bucket, and very few get the extra boost. Basically everyone knows they have to bust their humps to a ridiculous degree to get the booster. For example I only had one to give out in my group of 15, and everyone could easily have deserved it.

Anyway, we managers are required to select who gets that pay boost before anyone has written their self-assessments. We are required to make that selection in October, but the self-assessment write-ups aren't due until November, and my final manager's writeup isn't due until January. So basically writing the self-assessment is a total farce and means nothing. And the smarter employees know that. We all still have to "go through the motions" but we all know it's been locked in before any of this song and dance happens.

So today I pulled up a few of my employees self-assessment forms and laughed because it seemed so obvious to me that they used ChatGPT to write them. Their forms all read like a generic AI wrote them, then they just edited it to include more specific accomplishments that they have done.

And you know what? I'm not at all mad. I think that is an awesome way to save some time dealing with something that is honestly somewhat pointless.

Had a fairly cathartic conference recently involving Managers from a lot of other manufacturing companies where it was nice to hear that we all had very similar “frustrations” in our roles.

Since this sub appears to have a lot of Managers from completely separate career fields, I’m interested in hearing what elements of your job are the most mind-numbingly tiresome to you personally. Consider it a chance to rant on a Friday.

For myself I’d initially say it’s dealing with your habitual complainers or the employees who abuse FMLA, giving it a bad reputation when others truly need it, but after some discussion, I found that my biggest gripe has to do with how “performative” the job can be.

By this I’m referring to the slogans and silly business speak; the need to hold a plant-wide meeting to discuss “slips, trips, and falls” because someone rolled their ankle in the parking lot. The equally performative “corporate meetings” where Upper Management working from home try to sound stern about a host of topics. “Snapshot in time” moments where someone walks by and sees an employee with their winter coat by their workstation, and thus we need to crack down on the other 700 employees because “discipline is becoming a problem”. The incessant emails from clerks and secretaries who barely work 8 hours about spreadsheets and paperwork being 5 minutes late while you’re trying to settle a dispute between several employees. The list is endless.

Perhaps these are peculiar issues facing Operations Managers, and perhaps I’ve simply been in Management too long, but I’m interested in hearing of the frustrations other Managers have.

Lately I am seeing tons of posts from non-managers complaining about decisions their workplace is making. These aren’t well meaning questions wanting to understand the managers point of view, it is simply bitching about the workplace. Managers have to deal with this at work all day long, we don’t need it on our off time in a sub meant as a space for us to discuss our role. Please find a different sub to vent to.

Seeing some comments in this community has really gotten my brain churning. I’ve been managing restaurants for about 20 g.d. years, past few years moved into a GM role and started making more than I ever had before… $65k. I manage a 4-million a year restaurant with 30+ direct reports, including 4 asst managers. And I make $65k. Is this ridiculously low for my role?

How the hell do I transition out of restaurants into managing something that actually pays me what I’m worth when I’m working 60 hours/week?

Title pretty much says it. Is it grossly unprofessional? or does it just depend on my relationship with my team? I know that there are a few that have updated social media to indicate that they are open to work, but I expect that for every 1 person that has done that there is at least 1 person that hasn't but is still open/looking.

Edit: Just to clear this up... I am not frustrated at my folks for looking. I would like to be able to prepare them and plan myself if thats the case. I agree with the commenter; every job is a stepping stone in the progression of your career.

Update:
Thanks for all the info and good points. On our team call today I asked for more candid feedback around how they felt the projects and team was doing overall, if they had roadblocks on their individual projects, if they were happy with the work, etc. Everyone confirmed that they were "happy" but very busy. So I guess I have my starting point.

Thanks again!

I can’t stand my boss, how do I professionally let their boss know that they suck while maintaining balanced sounding feedback.

I am manager and I can normally provide balanced feedback but I can’t stand my boss and I’m finding it difficult.

Boss’s boss is remote so doesn’t see day to day but they do know that I am not a fan of my boss.

Update:

I would love to give details but I am not for obvious reasons. I will say this:

Boss is not at all clear with expectations but gets upset when things aren’t done in a way they expect. I do not fear speaking up so I’ve literally stated, “you need to make your expectations clear from the beginning.”

I’ve literally had this person say to me, “I’m really disappointed _______ isn’t happening or being done.” To which, I replied, “you need to make those expectations clear, because we had no idea that is what you wanted.” And honestly, this example was something really, really (like really) insignificant but a big deal was made of it until said that. My boss admitted I was right, but the behavior hasn’t stopped.

I have a staff member who absolutely refuses to get my attention (i.e. say my name, knock on my door, say “hey you”) before asking questions, making statements, or telling me something at all. We’ve had several conversations about it and how it has led to missed calls, issues not being resolved, tasks not being completed, etc. because I either (a) didn’t realize they were talking to me, or (b) was in the middle of a task, meeting, or PHONE CALL, and didn’t hear them. This has been going on for a couple months now and it isn’t getting better. Whenever I catch it happening, I make sure to point out that it isn’t appropriate, and my time isn’t being respected, and now they seem to think it’s like a joke or a game. Am I being petty?

So I’m a store manager at a retail store in the mall. Tonight I had an interview scheduled for 6:30 (which usually I don’t ever schedule them that late but I was trying to be accommodating to this person) and while I was waiting for them to show up someone else that is consistent customer that already filled out an application wanted an interview. Waited a little bit to see if the one I already scheduled would show up but after 10 minutes passed I decided to interview the person that was already here and ready. Did my whole interview with them and they did awesome so I hired them on the spot. The person who I actually scheduled for the interview called me (40 minutes after the scheduled time) saying they were on their way and I told them word for word “you’re already 40 minutes late, and just on the way now and that’s a really bad first impression so we’re not going to do the interview. I apologize, have a good night”.

You don’t get to waste my time like that and still have a chance at a job. Glad I still wound up hiring a good candidate

I just had a call with my boss regarding two employees I manage. He basically told me that we're going to "clean house" and eventually replace them. There are a variety of reasons I can't get into, but the situations between them aren't working out.

Deep down, I know it's the right decision and it needs to happen, but it's weighing heavy on my heart. I do like them as individuals, and they are good workers, we just need people more dependable.

What are the best ways to feel better about this? I know it won't happen overnight, and may take months. I'm just worried it's going to carry with me until it happens.

I requested to leave early 1 hour early on 10/06 for a medical appointment. My manager denied it. Since I started this job 2 months ago, I’m on a “probation period” for 90 days, which means I can’t take any PTO. Which I understand but I don’t want it paid. I just find it ironic that this huge corporate hospital denies my 1 hour of unscheduled PTO/ unpaid time off.

UPDATE *

I forgot to mention, Friday morning I had to take my toddler daughter to the emergency room. I called her to let her know if the situation. This woman, had the audacity to call me 45 mins after to ask me if I’m coming in and at what time.

Assume the new role isn’t outside your field or terrible grunt work. Same department, same people, similar work, but without people management responsibilites.

I have a direct report who has 2-5pm on Friday blocked off as “focus time” every week. I work remotely and so does he most of the time. I’m normally a hands off manager who believes that as long as people are getting their work done, I don’t need to be up in their business. I messaged him to check in on the status of a deliverable on Friday at 3 and he didn’t answer for two hours and his status that whole time was offline/not logged into any devices. I asked him to just tell me when he’s going to be out of office and keep his calendar updated. Note we already have Wednesday as no meeting day so people can get things done uninterrupted by meetings. Lately I’ve felt I’ve had to be following up more to make sure he’s getting things accomplished that he needs to. Do you think it’s reasonable that he can have this three hour block every Friday afternoon to apparently deep focus and for me to not bother him and he doesn’t have to be appear online and available? Part of me thinks he’s just taking Friday afternoons to chill. While I’m here working and so is the rest of the team. The part that’s weird to me is that who in their right mind thinks the best time for deep focusing is 2-5pm on Friday? am I crazy or should I just be ok with this? I put focus blocks on my calendar but I clearly show what I’m focusing on while he does not.

My boss, Director, seems to be gunning for one of my employees (we can call this employee “M”).

I guess I just need a gut check here. Here’s SOME of what’s happening:

M started about 6 months ago. M reports to me, I report to Director. We do not have “critical” jobs. There is no such thing as an emergency in our line of work. Our company has unlimited PTO, available as soon as someone starts.

Director is obsessed with M’s hours. M had a family emergency a few months ago and had to be out for a week. M has asked for another week off for the upcoming holidays. Director says 2 weeks in 6 months is more than M’s “fair share” of time off. I pulled up the PTO policy and literally read it to Director to remind her that M is well within the policy. No one has to pick up M’s slack when they are out and all of the team have taken far more than 2 weeks off. (I had to take almost a month off for major surgery, for example, and another employee took a six month sabbatical).

Director complained to me that M didn’t do a task for her in a timely manner. Upon investigating with Director what happened, Director gave M a task at 2pm and M completed it at 4pm the same day. Director didn’t give M a timeline when she delegated the task. Director wants me to “talk” to M about this.

Director complained that she didn’t know M had a day off. Even though M added their day off to the team’s “time off” calendar where it was perfectly visible to Director and there are no other requirements for notification (aside from leave form that I approve, which I did).

Director delegated a task to M at 3pm the day before M’s aforementioned day off. M admittedly didn’t see the request before they left at 5. This is probably the only legit complaint Director has at this point, but when I talked to her about it, Director admitted she only did it to “test” M to see if they would do it in time. 🙄

Director doesn’t do this with ANY of our other team members. IMO, M is a good employee and doesn’t deserve this level of scrutiny. Director also says really vague things about M such as she doesn’t “trust” M. When I ask for details, she can’t provide them.

My other concern is that M is the only member of our team who is a person of color. In the past, Director has made questionable statements about people of color such as “HR only wants us to interview that candidate because he’s black”.

Not sure what to do here. I am literally exhausted of this mess. Every week I’m defending M over what feel like nonsense “concerns”. It takes away from my job and it’s really impacting my mental health.

I have a Director level position. One of the reports being laid off is the manager who reports under me. It isn't performance related, just budget related. I tried to fight to keep both of them but I was overruled.

I feel terrible about it. Their yearly performance review just came up too. I wish I could warn them, but I'm supposed to keep this confidential. It's been eating me up inside for over a week.

Any advice is welcome.

Edit: I am told they are getting a healthy severance, but one of them just put an offer in on a house. I did disclose this information to "the powers that be". They weren't swayed.

So, i work at a company that doesnt really fire people. I cant give performance reviews to my direct reports. They basically allow people to "self-manage" thru this weird pure scrum philosphy. I dont even assign the team their projects.

the issues that this has caused is:

I had my Sr. Software Engineer open help desk tickets for the month the entire month of june and pretend she was working them herself. But, she doesnt even have the permissioning to do this work. its impossible. I was not allowed to remove her from her "work" and was asked to coach her to start selecting more appropriate work. She continues to assign herself 100 percent non-coding work.

I had a guy miss 50% of scrum ceremonies in July. Then was completely absent during business hours for august. What he did was sent his co workers work out pretending it was his own and accuse me repeatedly of not having enough meetings with him. He later admitted in writing that he wasnt at his house with his computer for the entire month of august as he was staying at his moms who just had surgery. He admitted after it became obvious as fuck as its been two months.

I had another guy who has called out of every single non-scrum ceremony meeting during the month of august. With me, my boss, with my peers. He missed the 1on1s. He missed the coaching meetings and even a meeting to discuss his attendance. As such, he was unable to start any of his work for the entire month. His excuses everytime is that he has to get medicine for a family member or his internet went out.

I have a "problem employee" that has given to me after being removed from a couple teams and has a close personal relationship outside of work with the managing director. She is my highest paid employee by far. She keeps doing things like sending out 100k emails on a loop to our end users, running up 50k bills in our database getting our entire teams access removed for the quarter.

I have weekly 1o1s. I have daily scrum calls. And I have kick off calls for each assignment and code reviews for the completion of each assignment. And these employees arent even doing software devolopment. Their performance has been so bad, that I am giving them basic task like "how many customers in our database table ABC do not have a phone number associated with them in Table DBE"

Also, for context. The team was originally staffed with 5 directors that were on the same par as me career wise. They staged a walk out and quit last june 2022. They were replaced with the problem employee and 3 Analyst/QA Engineer from a contracting company based out of columbia. They are all about 22-25 years old.

My question

I have a job offer for a contract job at a major company that would pay me more after tax/healthcare taken into account.

I am thinking of leaving because

it really does frustrate me to see someone come in every single day into our scrum call and literally pretend she is working a help desk ticket that another team is working. And im not allowed to take her off and give her real work.

Two guys have pretty much missed two months of work. One retrocatively said his mom had surgery.. to me this still unacceptable. and the other just uses his family as an excuse for everything . Since its a family first company, I am not allowed to say anything. However, I dont really believe them to be honest. you cant run family errands during every meeting for months on end.

Would you just quit? Ive only been here 5 months and this is alot of hands on "soft managing". I feel like since there are no consequences , people are just gaming the system. And since the employees are contractors, they dont really give a fuck about doing so

UPDATE: She came back around and said she’d settle for $24/hr. This afternoon, I walked through the machine shed into a cloud of weed smoke by her morning work station, right before she was going to go run some heavy machinery. She’s done. Decision suddenly became really easy. Thanks y’all.

I have an employee who has been on for under a year, and has done a pretty solid job. She takes initiative, she works hard, she stays late if needed, she spots problems and implements solutions. Occasionally, she makes a bad decision and implements it without first discussing it, which can be an issue, and she has broken a couple things on the job. Nothing that can’t be fixed, but she rushes sometimes. We’ve discussed it and she’s owned it. She has stirred some drama on the team, but nothing seriously detrimental to the business. Overall, a hardworking and reliable employee, with some rough edges that have caused minor issues.

Our company is growing, so we decided to offer her a promotion and a raise. Functionally, the promotion is a gentle shift in responsibilities. It would be the job she has been doing, but with an official title and some added responsibility in helping to train up new hires, and being involved in the interview process. She requested these responsibilities specifically. The job would put her in a senior position over a younger employee, to whom she’d be able to delegate tasks, enabling her to focus more on the tasks she enjoys and excels at.

In the future, the daily responsibilities would increase as we expand into new areas, and so would the pay. Nothing major changing in her day to day for awhile, it’s more about establishing what she’s been doing as an official title and solidifying the company hierarchy with future newcomers to the team. We told her we wanted to give her a raise from the current $20/hr pay rate to $22/hr.

$20/hr was already on the high end for similar jobs in our industry (average is about 25% lower than her current wage), so $22/hr is very high for the industry.

Her response was, “I’ve worked hard enough for you that I think I should either be on salary with a guaranteed 40 hours pay per week, or be given a raise to $26/hr, and also, I don’t want the extra responsibilities. I could have been working at ********** full time for the wage you’re now offering me, and enjoying that job a lot more. I’m really disappointed in you.”

I was taken aback by this response. We don’t have anyone on salary, the job doesn’t qualify anyway, and a 30% raise would be absolutely insane in our industry without a big jump in responsibilities. How do I handle this?

My initial response was, “That’s out of scope for this job. This offer is what we can do, which puts you in the top tier of income for this industry. We can’t match the other opportunity at *********, so that might be the better option for you, if that’s what you need.”

Anything I could do better? She hasn’t responded and has been avoiding me. I’m not sure how to proceed, as she appears to have declined the promotion that the raise is attached to with her response, but demanded more and is now avoiding me in the workplace. I can’t put through the raise without her agreement for the promotion, but we can’t just leave it hanging forever. Weird situation. Advice?

EDIT: I should mention that the competing job she cited in fact starts at $20/hr, and requires a 3 hour daily commute. That company is a recent startup on very shaky financial ground, already has a huge personal injury lawsuit by an employee they permanently maimed on the job, and relies on a lot of scammy volunteer acquisition to run the place with promises of goodies for volunteers that never seem to pan out (I.e. come volunteer and if you work hard enough, we might choose you to travel to Europe with us for horse shows!). I don’t think she’s aware of any of this.

Not sure if this belongs here, if not, I apologize, but I just need to get it out, vent to people who might understand.

At the plant I manage, we have a "work mom". She's an admin assistant to the GM and me. I sincerely hope you all have a work mom. She takes care of everyone. IYKYK

Yesterday, I was notified by my brother, a volunteer fireman, who also works for me, (he actually got me into the plant then I jumped over him) that he was responding to a traumatic arrest at work mom's house and they needed additional manpower.

I went to help if I could, but mostly for support of work mom and her family. When I arrived it was her husband, I suspended it was. I helped my brother with CPR until medics arrived. I have some experience as a fireman years ago, and I know my brother. When we were relieved he gave me the look, we both knew this was ending badly.

He stayed with the responders, I went inside. Work mom and her son were there her MIL had passed out and was being tended to by EMS. I worked on assisting but mostly started calming down the son and providing support to work mom (she literally offered to make lunch and coffee for the responders).

MIL was taken first, because she was in the best condition and husband was not stable enough to transport. A bit later the medics came in and informed us husband didn't make it. They were unable to bring him back.

I was there to offer support, and my brother was too. All the official questions were asked, paperwork was done, the medical examiner arrived and did his thing. During all that, work mom wanted to go see him, she had worked CPR on him before we arrived, so she knew what he looked like. I went with her, she said her goodbyes and I took her back inside.

Her son wanted to go see him, I told him that I can't stop him, and would go with him, but he should reconsider. Remember him as he was, not as he is. Thankfully he decided I was right.

After the body was transported, and the responders left (including my brother), they would have been alone for nearly an hour before friends and family arrived if I hadn't been there.

Normally I'm a supporter of not involving myself in the personal affairs of my people, but I am so glad I did. They did not need to be alone so soon.

If your new, learning, or seasoned managers, take care of your people, support them in every way you can. Sometimes the thing you'd never do, is exactly what you need to do. The death in their family is a death in mine.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I was made a manager 2 months ago of a location that was struggling when I was hired. The staff was under trained and over worked. The transition has been hectic at best, I have not been able to really discipline late staff members or other infractions because of the state of the situation, and I really have not received any training myself due to so many fires needing to be put out. This week every employee who was here before my arrival has put in 2 week notice. How do I move forward and rehire and restaff an entire facility while still being new? How also do I not take this personally when I really haven’t had negative feedback from the staff that is leaving?

Looking for some advice, throwaway account.

Hired a new employee a few months ago. He's great at his job but I struggle getting him in to the office.

During the interview, he asked if he can work from home. I said no. 100% onsite is in the job description, it's in his offer letter, it's in his employment contract. He lives an hour away but assured me it's no problem to come in.

He's in my office almost weekly asking if he can switch to remote. Answer is no, we need him onsite. Some of the duties could be done from home but some definitely cannot. Now he's threatening to quit if I don't let him switch. Calls in sick a lot. Makes special requests to leave early a lot. "Misses" lunch and then asks if he can go home early to make up for it.

Do I try and save this or just let him quit? He's phenomenal at his job - when I can get him here to do it.

Edit: for those who have questioned - this is an in person customer facing role. Paperwork and occasional calls can be done at home, but walk-up traffic is the majority of our workload.

Edit and update: well, he walked today, so I feel better about providing more details. We're an independently owned walk up mobile device repair company in Washington State. The tasks that could be done from home are just documentation, warranty lookups, calling customers with follow-ups, etc, but on most days those parts don't constitute a full day of work. An hour or two at most, and all the actual objective "hard" work would have to be shifted to his coworkers. The only way I could feasibly give him hybrid and still have a full day of work for him is if I let him take customer devices home to work on, which is an absolute hard stop no. Also there are multiple other people doing the same role as him, and I would have to give the same to all of them. For a walk up cell phone repair company, that just isn't feasible.

After really looking at his patterns of behavior, his attitudes at work, things he says to other coworkers, etcetera, I really get the feeling he was trying to get let go so he could collect unemployment. I don't believe he ever intended to be here very long.

To clarify the "phenomenal" comment - he's the best repair tech I've ever seen. That dude can whip a phone apart and back together in minutes. But as many have pointed out, he can't be phenomenal if he's not here to do the work.

Hi everyone,

Tl;dr at the bottom.

I have an employee who has been with us for about 15 years, and has grown within the company from the loading dock to a senior production planner. He has worked in almost every supply chain position within the company, and has recently accepted his new role as a Senior employee.

As a part of his role, he's our de-facto "fire fighter". He knows a lot about how the shop runs, and can jump into any number of roles to help out. My problem is that this new role has given him a terrible hero complex. He accepted his position, and the pay to go along with it, with the advanced knowledge of what he would be responsible for. Now, every day it's another story about how so-and-so screwed up and he needed to save the day. He makes sure everyone knows exactly what went wrong, and how he fixed it because nobody else could (not at all true... it's his job now).

On the one hand, he's a valuable employee who has been promoted and seen his pay increase because of the value he offers. On the other hand, people are getting really tired of being told how terrible they are and how amazing he is because he can do all of these things.

I offered to pay for a few classes to help him learn how to interact with others in his new role, and he told me he wasn't interested. If I wanted him to have the skills to manage other people, he needed to be a manager.

I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place.

Tl;dr- an experienced employee accepted a role as a general "fire fighter", solving problems as they arise. He now insists on talking to anyone that will listen about how terrible everyone else is at their job, and how amazing he is. People are getting tired of it.

EDIT: I have figured out who the complainer is….. I was not correct but very very close, it is someone who is on the other team that is sort of a manager AND….. One of my team members is sabotage us by telling this person bad things about my team…

I took my old managers place in the role about a year ago and for months now I have been hearing from my current manager that someone is telling them we do not “look busy” and that we are leaving “too early” and gives a bad perception of my team. I am pretty sure I know who is making these comments and it is the manager of a team similar to mine, kind of a ‘sister’ team.

The habits of my team have not changed since I started years ago (I was an individual contributor on the team before I got promoted to, manager when my manager left) they arrive and leave at the same time. I have communicated to my team what I have heard and asked them to be more diligent. I am not a micro manager and the most important thing to me is the performance of the team which is good. So while I don’t agree with the observations I have still told my team to be mindful.

I am getting extremely frustrated with the tattle telling and attempt at trying to get me to micromanage. My team gets in 30 mins - 1hr earlier than this sister team and only leaves about 10-15 minutes earlier than them. So my team is still in longer than they are yet the manager over there thinks we are “not busy”

How do I handle this? I don’t want to have to tell my team they must be not leave until some exact specified time on the clock, that’s ridiculous. But it may come down to it

I don’t know how to navigate this situation and it’s frustrating me to no end. Any advice is appreciated

For context my team is all around the ages of 30 (just to give you an idea of maturity levels these aren’t some irresponsible young 20s people or anything) normal office job and all exempt employees. Just to be clear we DO NOT submit time sheets

Greetings, laptop class. Unwashed hourly pleb, here.

Why do our "raises" never exceed 3% regardless of performance? Why do we get 300 pizza parties per year instead of something useful?

Love, Equipment Technician in Semiconductor

EDIT 1: Someone pointed out that r/csuite is a thing, so I posted this question there. Someone replied "Yeah, that's not really a question for this forum. That's a question for the management of your company." and then deleted my post.

EDIT 2: Looks like some other important-types overruled the person who deleted my post on r/csuite and I've received a couple more replies to it:

"Broadly though, if everyone in the economy got the 7% inflation rate, it would actually cause higher ongoing inflation in a wage price spiral, which would be bad for everyone. So there is actually an implicit responsibility to keep wage growth at reasonable levels."

I feel sometimes we’re managing middle schoolers. What do you all do when it becomes apparent that a group of people have targeted another employee? I have two strong workers (from an area I don’t manage) who have decided one of my team members is lacking. They email me daily with random complaints. I’m investigating but there doesn’t seem to be any true issues - just that they don’t like her. I’ll continue to respond but I want to tell them to just back off.

They’ve all worked here for ~5-10 years and have never gotten along.

EDIT: thank you to everyone who responded! I will take your advice in varying degrees and do an honest investigation into these claims while also supporting my employee. Thank you!

I have an excellent employee who has cataracts. He has health insurance through our company and we have pretty decent medical and vision coverage.

His vision is deteriorating and he's asking for cross-training/accomodationdur to that. I've spoken with him about the average costs of cataract surgery, showed him to research what our insurance will pay, etc.

He just won't do anything except keep asking if other positions are open that don't require him to focus his vision so much. Obviously, I don't know his financial situation but I also have cautioned him that if he doesn't have the cataracts removed, he'll go blind. I've also pointed out it's an ancient, incredibly safe, and common procedure with near 100% vision restoration.

I don't know what else I can do. I don't want to lose him from my team but mostly I don't want him going blind when it's preventable.

Any mother suggestions?

Not sure if this is the right sub, but just want to get it off my chest - fair warning, bit of a long one..

I work as a manager at a financial institution in the corporate sector. In 9 years I never had to terminate anyone until last year. I’ll refer to her as Amanda. This team member had attempted to commit fraud, however it was stopped before the payment was released into her account. The matter went through the formal disciplinary meetings so she could present her response (in which she tenuously argued that it was an accident..), however she was dismissed. She then lodged a claim against the employer for unfair dismissal and lost.

A couple of weeks after the tribunal hearing on a Friday night, I got a notification on Facebook that I was mentioned in a comment. “Is this an appropriate comment for a manager at ***** company to make publicly”? My Facebook profile is totally private and noone from my workplace is on it. The name I use in the workplace is an anglicised version of both my Christian and surname. I don’t have any public posts (except for the cover photo) and my workplace isn’t listed. I have no idea how Amanda found my profile, but she found a post I had made in a public group my friend and I created about 9 years ago. The group was intended for our local suburban community to make outrageous and nonsensical posts. This post was crudely making a joke about having diarrhea in public. That’s it. The profile that commented was totally blank, but I knew it was Amanda. I took a screenshot and emailed it to my boss and the HR manager. I deactivated my profile until I spoke to my boss.

On Monday, my boss told me that post had actually been sent to them by the same blank profile about a week ago via their corporate Facebook account, however they could see it was obviously vexatious and didn’t bother telling me so as not to stress me. As far as they were concerned the post was innocuous and we laughed it off.

One week later, my manager pulled me aside and started off by telling me to stay calm, that he knows I wasn’t responsible for what he is about to show me, but he needs to give me an update on the Amanda situation. He showed me on his computer a Facebook profile set up with my previous profile picture & cover photo which she must have saved, and used my name. Public information was set up to show my workplace and position title. The profile was created two days earlier on Saturday. In those two days, the profile had made numerous vile sexualised posts on their wall about me sexually harassing women, and one post stating that I had terminated a team members employment because she refused to perform a sex act on me…

It doesn’t stop there. The posts were filled with outraged comments from members of the public tagging the corporate account of my workplace. I asked my boss how this profile could have gained so much attention, and they showed me a post the profile had made on the wall of a local female celebrity, which stated my position title and workplace and asked for nude pics. This had gained hundreds of reactions.

I know my workplace knew it wasn’t me, but it was my face and name! What if it made it on the news? Anyway, the short of it is that my workplace took the time to send a detailed message to everyone who had commented and reacted (including the celebrity) to explain that they suspect a disgruntled former employee had falsely used the name and photo of their former leader, and they were referring this to the authorities. They also sent a PM to that fake account, and stated that every post and comment had been captured and was being reported to the police. The profile was swiftly deleted that morning.

How did this end? Well, cyber crime laws have NOT caught up with the times. It wasn’t considered harassment or identity theft. Nor did the police have definitive evidence it was her. My workplace was amazing though. I told them I wanted to file a civil suit against her, and requested support for the legal costs. Despite the suit technically being a private matter, they paid for the legal costs.

In court, Amanda denied that she was responsible for the cyber attack and claimed it could have been anybody. Fortunately for me, the only post referring to misconduct with an employee was the one she made relating to her termination. My lawyer asked her whether I sexually propositioned her in exchange for keeping her job, she answered immediately with YES. He then questioned how the person behind this fake profile could have known that if it wasn’t her or someone connected to her, and she was stumped. It was SO satisfying. She tried to say it could have been a different team member I fired, however as I said, she was the first staff member I had dismissed. Hilariously and a side note, I am actually gay. She didn’t know because no one in my workplace knows, not because I’m in the closet, but because I keep my personal and private life separate. The look on her face when this was revealed was priceless.

I was awarded a good settlement against her (and repaid my workplace for the legal costs!) and Amanda did not appeal the decision. I also used that civil judgement to get an aggravated violence order against her in the magistrate court, meaning if she violates the terms she will face a criminal court.

Make sure your workplace has your back as a manager when we have to do the dirty work like performance manage or terminate employment. If they don't - get another job.

May be more of a rant than anything. I became a manager a year and half ago, a couple months following we hired a new VP over our department. Since that day, we’ve turned over two-thirds of our department and I know at least two more will be leaving shortly, although they haven’t turned in their notice yet. My team has stayed in tact and my IC’s are generally happy.

But that’s changing soon, as my first ever direct report will be moving for personal reasons, and this one hurts the most. We have a great relationship and she’s my last work friend, it hurts both professionally and personally. I’ve worked really hard to build the culture on the team, but I cannot overcome the disdain for the VP or the other team’s manager.

I feel valued here, other departments respect me and are terrified I’ll be the next one to leave. I feel recognized for my contributions and it is a good company, I’ve been treated well with more room for growth. But the mental strain of people leaving, endless interviewing while also training and completing my own tasks is just completely exhausting and I’m approaching burn out. Is this normal in mid-level management?

I'm planning to quit my job. I do all of the HR at my company, as well as all of the bookkeeping. I have been here a little over a year. My predecessor spent months finding me and also spent 3 months training me. Nobody else has access to any of the bookkeeping or financial accounts, except the CEO who is not a bookkeeper.

There are a lot of good people here. We are a modest small/medium company, but steady, and a lot of people here like their jobs. I don't want anyone to miss a payday...

Unfortunately there is a person here, the only other director level employee, who is completely unacceptable, totally out of line. He guards access to the back end of the software because that gives him job security, meanwhile he refuses to do anything productive and makes you regret asking him anything. I cannot work with him. I have had issue after issue with him. I did talk to our CEO about it and she said, "Oh yeah, everyone has these issues with Gary. You are doing a great job of handling it." She also said she would never fire him.

What's my strategy here? I am going to start my own company now and I'm happy for this experience to give me confidence in running a company. But I don't want to stay a long time after I give notice. I'm considering offering to stay more than 2 weeks for higher pay. How do I professionally do this? She is a business leader in our community and I don't want to be on her bad side. I'm not used to playing hard-ball negotiating but I have made my mind and I want to get on to my next project.

What are you no longer allowed to say to your team now that you are a manager? Mine is “sucks to suck.” I just wish I could say that to my next employee who whines about an easy to solve problem. How about you?

My boss recently found my resume on a job board and called me directly and asked me point blank if I was applying for new jobs.

I shared with her months earlier that I was in a tough financial position and was unsure of how I felt over the next few months. And that I may have to find another role to support my family. My boss agreed and said they would support me once that time came

Well a few days ago my boss found my resume on a job board as I was recommended by the platform for a job they had posted because of similarities in my experience and what they were looking for.

She just asked me to keep open dialogue about my plans and said they understood my position, I said I was hoping to wait out the holidays so I could speak with her, given my spouse is looking for a job too and her getting a job would allow me to continue with my current role. Unfortunately my boss expressed in terms of compensation there isn’t much more room to grow to where I would like to be but asked if there was anything else the organization could do to be competitive, which I answered, saying I knew there was no room to grow which is why I had started consider moving elsewhere.

As a manager what would you do, if you found out your employee had an active resume on a job board?

Hired a new team member 3 months ago, after team begged for an extra person due to how overworked they felt (how overworked our department actually is is debatable… less down time than we’re used to and more multi-tasking but work is getting done, no overtime required, still have time to chat and goof off.)

Now that we have new team member, they’re still unhappy because they really just don’t seem to like her. She’s a bit eccentric, not a down-home middle-aged country gal like most of the team (I’ll add that we’re all female, myself included.) The complaints are - she won’t ask for help. Well, when she asks for help they won’t help her. They say it’s because she argues with them when she asks for help - I see it as she wants to understand the why of our rules and actually help the customer. Something I don’t see veteran employees wanting to do. They just do it because that’s the way we do it. I’d gladly replace two of my veterans with a lady like my new hire, and I’m frankly getting sick of their apparent disdain and I’m not sure how to address it with them and also make new lady feel welcome - although, I guess, she’s not by most.

Any advice?

As posted above. My weekly numbers depend on my coworker’s number. But she doesn’t complete her task on time and then won’t notify me when it’s ready. Yesterday, at 5:40pm I asked if her task was done and she said yes. I checked the time stamp and it was done an hour earlier she just doesn’t notify me.

Normal workday ends at 6pm and I didn’t get to start my work until 5:40pm and I ended up working till 2am!!

This isn’t a one-time thing. It happens often. My manager is freaking useless. Just won’t say anything when I’ve told him it’s not fair that my workday starts so much later because of my coworker.

Please advise on what to do other than quit. Finding a new job is on the horizon but it won’t happen quickly. I also need to learn to stand up for myself and learn to navigate such situations.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I've only been a manager for two months, but today I told my supervisor that I want to relinquish the position. I stepped up after the previous manager abruptly left. I didn't really want the role, but I was committed to the project and I know the ins and outs of it better than anyone. But just two months on the job has killed my spirit. There are some deep seated problems withn my team (lack of critical thinking, unwillingness to learn/follow process) that I thought I could help fix. But my move into the manager role made us painfully short staffed in an area we were already struggling in. Now we're woefully behind and the client is getting upset...

All that I could've handled if I were able to devote my time to those issues. Instead, most of my day is spent fielding countless emails. I monitor two Outlook accounts and both can easily receive upwards of 50 emails a day. Some are just cc's but a lot of them are questions that have to be answered and I don't have the luxury of ignoring them or delegating them to other people.

Most of the time I feel like a glorified babysitter to a band of clanking monkeys. I know that's horrible to say, but it's true. I don't have the patience and the people skills for this job. I feel like a failure.

A turd in this case can be the manager or the employee or the situation or the company. It’s just not working out and if the employee doesn’t want to go on PIP they should be offered a reasonable package to leave and everyone can live happily ever after.

I wish my company has this policy!

I’ve recently joined a job as a manager, and I’ve been given an iPhone 14 as a work phone. I still haven’t set it up due to laziness, but do intend to. I’m currently using an old, shitty spare phone I have as my work phone. Today my manager asked me if she could borrow my brand new iPhone 14 work phone for her daughter who has smashed her phone. I feel this is an extremely odd request and given I struggle to say no, have said okay, but feel extremely uncomfortable about this. What do ppl think about this request?

I terminated an employee today. It's not the first time I've had to do this. But this one hit hard. I had coached this person and given him so many chances. So many! This case had been under HR review for a long time, about 2 months. I hate when they drag their feet because it's hard to deliver the message once they finally decide.

I just feel drained, emotionally. I don't know if I'll ever get used to this part of the job. I keep thinking of how he had to go home and tell his family. I feel like I'm the failure, as a mentor and a boss. Can any of you relate?

How do you all deal with returning from vacation? I’ve got 600 emails and 5 hours of newly scheduled meetings with little time to prepare, in addition to my post-vacation check-ins with my direct reports.

I’m now more stressed than when I left…

UPDATE: thanks to the many comments here, I was able to convince my leadership team to add Cash Money as a gift option! This year, each employee will choose from a small Solo stove, a set of 4 deluxe camping chairs, or Cash money 🤑

For my fellow managers, don’t be afraid to respectfully speak up for your employees! It’s hard, but it’s why you are there. I am so glad that I did, and so glad that I have a leadership team to hear me out.

Edit: thank you to everyone for sharing your ideas. To clarify for those who keep asking why I stated ‘skipping the obvious’- I meant this as a way to brainstorm other ideas, I know that the best gift is money, and if not that, gift cards.

Leadership at my company gives a gift in addition to the end of year bonus, and were seeking ideas. I thought it would be good to see what people in general like, aside from the obvious we all already know. I am not sure yet if I am going to tell the president people think his gifts are crap and that he should just up the bonuses- I am not sure if I have enough tact to do so effectively without losing my job, but I am considering it. I do find it rude to tell someone else how to spend their money. In any case, I will suggest gift cards to a variety of grocery stores.

I did hear tons of Yeti suggestions- they did yetis for everyone plus their family members regardless of size last year and apparently it was a big hit.

Good luck everyone, and I hope you keep in mind this post in your end of year giving and receiving and be mindful of the intention of others around you!

This one is more for the non-managers that lurk here, but can also serve as a reminder to existing managers or a heads up to new managers.

Managers have managers as well; even in smaller environments, rarely will an individual report to the "top dog".

This is important to keep in mind because sometimes your manager has to do stuff that even they don't want to do. Return to office (RTO) is a good example. Your manager likely enjoys WFH and being remote just as much as you do, but they have to enforce RTO or else they will get fired, just like you.

Managers have to play politics. Let's say your team has an issue with a person on another team. You complain to your manager and wonder why the behavior still continues. Well, your manager needs to find time to take your complaint, investigate it, build a case, find proof and evidence, determine a recommendation and solution, and present that to the person's manager. That person's manager may be more senior or difficult to engage. That person's manager may also tell your manager to pound sand. The sugar approach didn't work so now your manager needs to determine if it is worthy of escalation to either their manager or the other person's manager. Suddenly this isn't a "make it stop" thing, but something that gets exponentially more complicated.

Business is slow-moving. Your manager attends meetings with other managers and needs to air the concerns of the team, get support, and advocate for your team. Something that seems important to you and your team, may be inconsequential to the company. It is up to your manager to push this along.

All of this is to say you may have an outstanding manager who is mired down by a mucky company and other managers who refuse to do anything.

If anyone wants to read a good book that goes into this in detail, read "Managing from the Middle" which talks about how Managers are in a great spot to exert influence downwards (which we all know) but also to the sides (their peers) and upwards (to the business managers that aren't aware of what is happening "on the front lines".

Of course, none of this excuses a crappy manager, but it is why even a mediocre manager can look bad. All of this is on top of budgeting, resource allocation, supporting their team, and jumping in to help with any work that may be needed due to people being OOO or a surge of work coming in.

I took a new management position and I have a mentor. I hope I’m not expected to do as she does as her style is not for me.

She will message her employees on teams, one message after another after another, asking questions about their work. Is this done, is that done, where are you on this and that, when will this be finished, have you done this yet…..Within two minutes she sent one employee 8 teams messages. I imagine it to be stressful and overwhelming to be on the receiving end getting pounded with questions, no breather and no time to actually respond. I was stressed for the employee.

Then she sends emails like “I noticed you did abc, is there a reason you didn’t do D.” These are adult professionals! That’s similar to an approach I took with my children when they were young and I knew they were lying.

Today she said to me “let’s work your team and get some teams messages out to see where things stand”. I told her I will address my team how I feel is best for them and she TATTLED.

Is her approach normal? I never managed like that.

I started managing a new team 3 weeks ago, and although I’m an experienced manager it’s a new team I’m not familiar with. The team and have recently been restructured and the overall morale isn’t great and I’m identifying ways to support this.

Last week, I realise it’s the start Novemeber and there is no Christmas party planned. We are given some money for this activity, and it an expectation this happens. There’s 40 of us, and it’s the expectation there should be a lunch/afternoon meal. I speak to my 4 ‘managers’ in the team, and based on Semester dates, annual leave in the run up to Christmas, we have one week option where it would be feasible to take the team out the office. Myself and then 4x managers pragmatically make a judgement call on a preferred date option based on people’s working patterns and quick look at diaries (no major committees, events etc) After calling 10+ restaurants, I’m able to locate somewhere that has room for 40 people close to the office. Not easy.

Invite issues to teams, hears nothing more. I now have a member of the team threatening a complaint because he cannot make the lunch due to previously planned leave, and was not consulted about the proposed date when he should have been. He feels it’s unfair a poll wasn’t taken on availability.

I’ve tried to appease by offering to change the date, but when explored with the team, 4+ people cannot make the alternative date. The restaurant also can’t accommodate us until later on in the day which has a knock on effect for other commitments after working hours.

Does this seem like a reasonable reaction? Have I mis-managed this approach? I wasn’t expecting such a response.

Ideally this would have been booked months ago due to size of the team and limited options to hold an event. At this point in the year, I felt I tried hard to atleast offer an option and appeared to work for the vast majority of the team given how late in planning the event is.

I have an employee who just can not think for themselves, and everything is over the top.... "too hard." When an email comes in, they will read it and loudly say, "I'm so confused or I don't understand." I've explained to them that it is okay to think this, but to say it outloud is unprofessional and inappropriate. I ask them to read the email again, one sentence at a time, and see if slowing down helps with understanding and then advise them to use the resources to troubleshoot. This usually solves the drama.......but others in the office, including myself, are getting really annoyed, and it makes them look so incompetent.

Besides telling them to keep her mouth shut, what is a better way to address this? For awhile, I thought this was a generation thing (I'm GenX), but maybe it's just a personality conflict?

Edit: Thank you all for your comments. I've read them all and will be using some of these as tools to help this employee and tools that I may need in the future.

The unfortunate part is I was forced to hire this person and they didn't know how Outlook worked within an office setting.....it's been a challenge and while they are learning, this is one piece that just needs to stop.

It seems like every other post here is a "Stupid employee was stupid" post. What are your wins?

I've been on the same team for over 5 years and I just registered in my consciousness that we ALWAYS end group meetings small and large with a chorus of everyone saying "thank you".

I love it. It's a nice way to end. Curious if this common or just us?

Edit to add: these are virtual meetings, so when presenter or I close the meeting, all 5 to 20 people come off mute, say thank you then leave the zoom. For some reason it's been cracking me up lately

Posted here a while ago about one of my employees. He has awful money management, to the point that it affects his work. This guy is a late 20s data engineer, making data engineer money, about the midpoint of my team.

Examples: He doesn't show up to team happy hour because he can't afford to fix his car!? This has happened twice. We're mostly remote, we have 3 or 4 events in person a year. He and I are both local, he really should attend them since 15 other people are flying in. If he said he had an appointment, fine. But instead he bitches to the team that he can't attend because he can't afford to fix his car. He could Uber there but instead he bitches about it.

He asked for an advance, twice in the past months. I had to go to finance and ask about this, making me look like a dope.

But the biggest problem is he bitches about money in the downtime before meetings. Its unprofessional, makes other people uncomfortable. He bitches about money in 1-1 meetings and stuff like code reviews.

And when I mean bad with money. He owns a house and has never lived in it. I think he's paying rent somewhere, and he's paying a mortgage too. Yes that will make you broke. I really don't think he has a drug or gambling or hooker problem. He's just comically bad with money and he bitches about it.

Anyway, based on my last post, I hooked him up with our EAP people and they had something about finance. It didn't help worth a damn, and he's still up to his ass in payday loans. And constantly letting everyone know about it.

I have talked to him several times, tried to get him to understand boundaries. He is okay for a half a week and then right back to it.

Here's my question: Would you put very reliable, smart, gets stuff done employee on a PIP because of this? If I do that, I have to follow through and it would probably end in me firing him. Which seems nuts, but also this cannot go on.

I'm at a total loss here.

Edit: Enough with the unprofessional comments from non managers.

There was this woman at my last job that was both friends with the department head and constantly played sympathy card. So, she had been at the company 5 years. And "given" to 3 teams, because she does no fucking work and has to be the "lead" on all the important stuff.

When I had started, she had completely made up her own responsibilities and even had pretend meetings where she claimed she was training other employees all day on how to do these basic task. This is how she got caught, because the other employees said that they had no idea what she was talking about.

The Department Head called me in after finding out and said it was my responsibility to inspire and motivate her better. And i just need to define the "working arrangement" between me and her

But, its hard to define a working arrangement or boundaries with someone who does whatever they fuck she wants with no consequences. She got my whole teams access removed from our database by fucking it up so bad...

I was called in and asked to motivate her more.

She started missing meetings, She was simply told that was ok, just make sure to follow up with me when she is available. And thats when i quit, as i was pretty much on demand call for my own direct report.

I quit and they were kind of assholes to me lol. Said how bad of an impression it was to quit and really condescending.

Two months later the shitty employee is fired and the dept head is no longer the dept head and is being heavily scrutinized right now.

What pisses me off is that how badly i was spoken to for them to immediately turn around and act on everything i said and fire the girl and remove the guy protecting her.

Have you guys ever had a situation like this? Where you felt like you had to quit because you had a poor direct report that was sticking you with their work and just causing you issues, making you look bad, and not helping at all?

Basically the title. I have a manager level coworker whose leaving the company. They did great work for the department for years. Why is it so hard for management to wish them well? Why do we let this old school menality of hatred for people not staying forever/being loyal to seep into the simplist courties of thanking someone for the contribution they made to their department? It's just funny because in previous manager meetings they tell people to 'forge their own path' 'nobody owes anyone a career' etc etc. Then when they do it's angry Pikachu face. I wished them well, I will always wish anybody leaving well. Just don't get why everybody else can't grow up and take the stick out of their butt.

I manage a team of social workers at a small non-profit. This week our business office manager passed away from cancer. She pretty much worked right up until the end and many members of my team were very close with her. She was hilarious, sweet, and just an amazing person. We've watched her battle cancer for years but this still feels shocking to me and my staff members. I've worked in hospice and I've worked a lot with grief. We all have. But somehow this feels difficult to navigate. It's hard to watch my team struggle with this. We had a team meeting today and I opened it up for people to share and connect (with the caveat of: this is optional, you can share as much or as little as you want and you can log off zoom if it's too much). A few of us shared funny stories about the woman who passed and that felt cathartic...but I don't know where to go from here. I am extending deadlines for tasks that aren't time sensitive, helping offload duties as much as I can, etc. What else can I do to support my team? And how do I make sure I don't burn out in the process?

So I just took over managing a department in a college. I’ve only spent 1/2 days in office but I’ve noticed there’s a very negative clique.

The guy who was in the job before me seemed to be a part of this group. They are constantly criticising newer members of staff to their face and in front of the students. I reminded one of them that everyone does things differently and we need to respect people doing their job.

They want it to run the same way the old guy did by the look of it so I know if I don’t tackle this now there will be a clash with me in future if I don’t do things their way.

This is data from a new Microsoft study.
The study also shows that "87% of workers say their productivity is just fine." Whoops.
Fortunately, Microsoft added in the same breath that managers SHOULD NOT spy on their teams.
I agree – as spying on people for productivity fears can harm trust, employee engagement, and well-being:

As I've heard from many of the people interviewed on the Future Work podcast, TRUST is a fundamental pillar of positive employee-manager relationships, and when employees feel like they are being constantly monitored or spied on, it erodes that trust.

Surveillance can create a culture of fear and anxiety, where employees feel constantly watched and judged. This can lead to decreased trust and disengagement, as employees may focus more on APPEARING BUSY than being productive.

Constant surveillance can also stifle creativity and innovation. When employees feel like they are constantly being monitored, they may be less likely to take risks or think outside the box. Autonomy and psychological safety are crucial for empowering employees to make decisions and contribute their unique perspectives, ultimately leading to more innovative solutions.

Spying on employees can blur the boundaries between work and personal life. It can create a sense of being constantly "on" and lead to burnout. Respecting employees' time and allowing them to have a healthy work-life balance is essential for their well-being and long-term productivity.

TLDR; (How) Would you try to communicate up the chain to Csuite about the need for COL raises or would you just leave a job where you love your team like family?

I'm a relatively new low level manager in a corporate office. I've been with the company many years and worked my way up from entry level. I've always known the upper management were extremely conservative and cost-conscious but I've had valid support for my promotions through that time so it didn't bother me much. Now I'm at a point where I don't expect another promotion for some years but this year was the most profitable year the company has had in literally decades and...no raises. None. And everyone was so angry that it became very vocal complaint around the office. I come to find out that while I've had promotions through the years, some of my excellent colleagues haven't seen any raise at all in 5+ years! (Why are they still around, you ask? I can't fathom... and now I feel a little guilty for my success while others I value get shit on..). I spoke with my director about what's the standard policy for annual review and evaluating raises that I can share with my direct reports? The answer I got boiled down to it's entirely up to the Csuite and they don't believe in annual raises. They have to be fought for. Turns out this director was the reason I was promoted along the way when I gave him the ammunition. This team has become like family and I value many things more than the money. That said, isn't it a little blind to stay somewhere that isn't apparently going to give even a small 3% and hasn't in years? I truly don't know how anyone has stuck around who hasn't been in my position of upward trajectory. I want to send a message up the chain to say this is not ok, this office is in revolt, I assume other locations are too, and if it happens again there's bound to be some very detrimental turnover and loss of amazing talent. I can't just go emailing the Csuite though... what do you do? Just leave with the rest of the wave when it happens and grieve for the poor judgement of the upper management?

I found this subreddit about a year ago and I love it! I’m a first time manager going on 2 years and I’ve gotten a lot of really good advice from this sub. But I’ve been seeing a lot of posts/comments from more “laidback” managers shaming managers that need to be more “strict,” for lack of better words.

Some examples of what I’m referring to: “as long as my employee’s get their work done, I don’t care what they do.” Or someone posting about reprimanding their employees and there will be comments like “if they’re doing their job why do you care if they’re 10 minutes late? Or I was looking into ideas for team bonding and saw some comments saying things like “don’t force your employees to do team bonding at a work meeting. Go out and do a fun activity together, like an escape room.”

And while I love this way of thinking, and I would love the flexibility to do this, I want to share a reminder that this isn’t always possible for every manager, and that’s okay. I manage a team in a low funded field in healthcare that’s staffed 24/7/365. We have to have at least 3 employees working at all times. If someone is 10 minutes late everyday and causing another employee to have to stay 10 minutes late everyday, I’m not going to let them burn out other employees. And I would love to do a team bonding that’s fun and outside of the workplace, but we would always be missing at least 3 members of our team. That, along with the company I work for being a low-funded organization. So there’s not a whole lot of money to throw around for things like escape rooms for 20+ people, as much as I wish that there was.

I try and be as nice and giving as much as I can, but sometimes I can’t afford to be. Do what’s right for YOUR situation and the company YOU work for.

I woke up very tired and I haven't slept well the last two nights. I never take sick time until I have a name brand sickness (flu, covid, something.) I called in sick today and feeling rather guilty. I know I shouldn't feel guilty.

I send a slack message and everyone is pouring kind thoughts etc. Makes the guilt only bigger.

As the title says, I wondered if other managers can share some words or phrases to use, or avoid when terminating an employee.

I’m a relatively new manager and have had to let a couple of people go in this time. Whilst I don’t want to sugar coat the conversation or dance around the issue, I feel that in the past I haven’t handled it with the respectfulness that I could have. Mainly around wording and how quickly I get to the point.

Thank you.

I am a new manager at my local hospital and I currently manage three of their pediatric clinics. There’s this nurse who’s been consistently causing issues with front desk and other nursing staff by making them feel “less-than” or “below her” with her out of pocket comments. The first instance was back in may when I had to sit her down for telling the front desk “I’m the nurse and you’re just front desk”. I sat her down and spoke to her and the front desk about this together, she apologized and we decided to move forward. Another instance happened where she was giving front desk #2 more work and not running it by me first. I sat her down and told her that any extra work HAS to go through me first before being delegated off. She apologized and we kept it moving. This third instance is with a nurse named “sam” who she had a bit of a back and forth with and said the following “You’re a medical assistant, Sam, focus,” the way sam took this was that “Susan” the RN was being derogatory to her by using her title.

There’s been instances where this “Susan” gets easily flustered and blows up when things don’t go perfect at the clinic. She cannot handle stress or things popping off. Everything has to go according to plan or she will freak. When this happens, she usually says “I hate working here” or “I don’t want to work here anymore”

I haven’t given her a verbal or a write up but have documented everything in her file. I haven’t because my upper managers tell me to just keep the peace and let it roll for retentions purposes. Yet, her latest comment to “Sam” was so out of pocket and some providers heard it as well.

Now “Sam” wants to quit because of “Susan” and feels like things aren’t being handled appropriately.

“Sam” is an amazing employee and I don’t want to lose her.

I’ve decided to write “Susan” up. However, since she’s so snappy and problematic, I know she’s going to be a crying mess when I do this. What do I say during the counseling to nip all of this in the bud? Just say what I wrote? What can I legally say without overstepping?

Im completely new to management and have never had to do this before. I hate confrontation so much!!! But I’m learning and I can only improve!

Please any advice would be awesome!

We’ve probably all heard that "people don’t leave jobs, they leave bad/toxic managers."
Do you think the opposite can also be true: managers don’t leave jobs, they leave bad/toxic teams?

Previous posts backstory: Previous posts described difficulty managing half-time employee that I did not supervise; escalated to mediation, which ended in creating a Work Agreement that essentially acted as a PIP as we both had to meet the terms.

....and she was let go this week. For breaking the agreement terms. It was a huge red flag for our director when the problem employee no-showed to the meeting to sign the agreement—she "forgot"—then apparently she broke the agreement pretty much immediately.

I have no idea what terms she broke, as I was not informed and HR was insistent that I stay as far away from it as possible. Apparently HR performed an investigation over the last few weeks and on Tuesday this week, I was told that the employee was being released that day. I was asked to stay in my office while it was happening, which I did.

After an hour, I texted another program leader (also informed about it that morning) to ask if it was safe to come out, and he texted back that the employee stayed to eat her lunch. She was fired, then sat in the conference room alone eating her lunch for an hour, then finally left. I continue to be baffled by this person. It's quite literally the strangest behavior I've ever experienced. It's not my problem anymore, but seriously, what. the. fuck?

After I was finally able to leave my office, I had to message the stakeholders about the staffing change and had to begin the paperwork to rehire. It felt really fast, like I barely had time to process, but it was fine. The good news is that the director listened to my needs and I was firm that the prior shared supervision did not work. Now the new position will be fully under my program, with minimal 'front desk' coverage (they still need someone to sit at the front desk in afternoons, which I am fine with, as long as I can hire someone under the program who understands the youth work we do and the sensitive nature of the non-profit we work for).

I also hired for the full-time position and that person started last week, so we'll have a small team once I fill this position and we can rebuild our program. Still cautiously optimistic, as I feel like things went too far with this person for too long and it has made me lose some trust in leadership.

TL:DR - troublesome employee was released, I am hiring for the position fully under my department (no more shared supervision), and I feel at least supported in some capacity by my organization.

After 2 months the staff member continues to be employed by the company yet has proven incapable and unable to function and has come to learn almost nothing about the assigned projects. Arriving late, leaving early and missing days altogether. Falling asleep at his desk and even one time in a conference room falling asleep during an important meeting. Often smelling of peppermint schnapps. He is not a functional alcoholic and has conducted no meaningful work whatsoever all on a six figure salary.

The department manager (who my boss reports to) last week ‘indicated’ via back channels that he would not block the dismissal of this staff member however requiring it to be done thru HR and in such a way that he will not be held accountable for any decisions. Also he still doesn’t want anything in writing.

So last week I went to the HR office on how to do this (not email) and they provided me printout of a 7 page PIP template and wished me luck. They will not put anything in writing nor will they tell me what to do. They would not email me the template.

Today, totally unrelated to any of this, our office held a workshop focused on company values of accountability, ethics, and continuous improvement. The staff member had been drinking. I asked the division manager (my boss) how this situation should be handled in light of company values. It was a long conversation. He called HR, who conducted a breathalyzer (they would not tell me the results) but suspended the staff member for 3 days and won’t tell me anything else.

It continues to be an incredible situation.

I’m convinced that this staff member is not a personal friend of anyone. The situation appears to be this: The department manager (who is a PHD )will simply not accept that he personally made a poor hiring decision (he was the only one involved). He’s proud of his “talent management certifications” and somehow thinks that this will all just work out?

I have a new team and looking to have a weekly one on one meetings with my team but they are freaking out already. They never had one on one before. Are these effective or just waste of time? What do you ask on your one on one meetings? Any tips or suggestions?

Once my dad told me that his boss started shouting at him (he had in the field more than 20 years experience but his boss was the owner)and it turned out my dad did the right thing.

My parents think if managers apologize, they will have less respect from their employees.

So I'm curious: Do managers ever apologize if they do something wrong?

Edit : Thank you for the answers. I want to be a good manager one day so that people who work with me will have a great career. Honestly, I have maybe a really optimistic place in my mind about being a manager and having a team and working for a company where I can enjoy working with my future team. Edit2 : they don't believe in their methods they just told me that every boss do this, and its normal, and they say wanting to have a boss who is like that is kinda impossible and naive.

How do you cope with the constant people-ing you have to do as a manager?

I’m pretty good about disconnecting from it all and recharging on the weekends, but weeknights are hard. Some days I come home totally overstimulated, and it takes me hours to get back to normal. I’m often replaying the day’s conversations in my mind and working through problems off the clock.

Any tips for slowing down, shutting off the “work brain,” and recharging on weeknights?

I interviewed this guy on Wednesday the day before Thanksgiving. He told me he would get back to me Friday and let us know if he wanted to job. He went an interviewed at another location same day and told them the same thing (same company). He never called us back that week, I called him Monday to follow up and he said he hadn't made up his mind and would get back to me when he knew. He called back Wednesday (2 days later) and said he would take the job offer. I inquired as to when we could plan his start date to be and he said he would call me back after putting in his two weeks at his current job. He never called but texted me 2 days later Friday night saying his next day off was Saturday (the next day, yesterday) and I asked is he could come in so we could do his payroll paperwork so he was all set there and set a start date. He never showed up, I texted him midday asking if he was still coming up to do his paperwork and he never responded.

We need the help badly. But reliability is important and he isn't exactly starting off great in that department. He has yet to follow through with a single thing he has said he would do. I'm tempted to call me him Monday and say sorry but we are going in a different direction and leave it at that. Thoughts?

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies. I'm inclined to move on as just about everyone is saying.

We are in a really tough spot though and it's either me or the owner doing this portion of the job and it's wearing us down. He doesn't mind it as much since I handle the front fine without help, but its tough to keep dealing with this.

In the last 6 weeks we have called back at least a dozen applicants with half getting back to us and setting up an interview, but only 2 have actually shown up. One barely spoke English and we couldn't understand each other. This was the other guy, who came more prepared than any other person I've hired in the 7 years I've been here. He was an absolute hire for me, but I could tell he wanted more. It would be nice to offer him that directly, but that's not the reality of this industry (blue collar skill based) for anyone, it takes time to prove it and earn it. I didn't want to hire this guy and have him walk right out. I wanted him to fully understand everything and be happy with it, and my offer was a more than fair offer.

Tomorrow I will talk to the owner and possibly call or text him back one more time saying we need to set a date by X or we need to move on, based on what he wants to do. It's his business his decision. I really want him to work with us but I want a reliable employee more.

EDIT 2: Since so many people are bringing up pay. First of all, if my pay rate was the problem he wouldn't have said yes to me and no to the multiple other places he said no to. What he wants is a position he isn't qualified for and no we aren't going to pay him that level of wage until he gets there ability wise. In my area these jobs are posted for 17-22 and 22 is way out in the middle of nowhere, city jobs are under 18, I'm offering 20. If that doesn't sound like a livable wage you don't live in my state or understand my industry. Money isn't the issue. In about 2 years he will be making more than 60k, so to start at 42k is fine.

*FINAL EDIT: We moved on, I made the decision, I texted him Monday and said we need a definitive date by tomorrow or we need to move on and never heard back. As far as what now. I took a lot of these comments here to heart although my idea may not be what everyone had in mind I think it's a good blend of both plus some of my own ideas mixed in.

This is in auto repair to clarify, my next offer will be 17/hr, plus spiffs per job. Examples of spiffs, light bulb $3, headlight $5, battery $10, alignment $15 (while training) then $20, filters 2 per engine 3 per cabin, $5 per tire, $7 per tire repair FOUND, wipers $1 each. While these sound like mediocre numbers they add up quickly and pays the tech for each item rather than a commission which could get bombed by one slow day and that's not fair. So let's say he has an oil change and 4 tires to do, he sells both filters and a brake light, he makes 17/hr +20 for 4 tires +5 for filters +3 for brake light. He made $45 while working on that car. If he stands around and does nothing he gets 17/hr.

I think this is a fair medium between more pay and better incentivised pay without costing us more money if they end up being worthless. On top of that, there will be a 6 month review, 12 month review, and an annual review every year after that. As long as defined goals we set out are being achieved they will get a raise at each review. Meaning by end of 12 months they could be at 20/hr plus the spiffs. During these reviews we will also assess if they are ready to move up to the next level or where they are on that side of things if that's what they want to do.

Also, I am going to get our entire company started on a tool program, where we offer to help with these young techs getting set up with tools. Where we give them an annual bonus, plus use our business connections to get better deals on tools from our suppliers and pass off 100% of those savings to our employees. We can even formulate a payment plan based on how long you've been here. So at 6 months you have $1,000 in credit and at 1 year $3000 and so on.

I also want to include an actual training program but we need more than one hire for something like that. I have talked to our director of operations about hitting some high schools with vocational training about summer or part time jobs for seniors too.

Thanks for all the advise, I think it helped a lot and my owner was very receptive to this after we went over the actual numbers.

I manage a small team of 10 people.

They have a little break room with a microwave and a small toaster oven.

I got complaints from my team that two employees regularly stink up the break room with their food.

One of them cooks fish everyday in the microwave and the other one regularly cooks stuff that is very potent (Some of her co-workers told me it smelled like “road kill”).

I smelled the fish myself a few times and yea…it’s not a pleasant smell and it tends to linger for hours after she cooks it.

I got them an air freshner spray as a temporary solution but they are still complaining.

I am not sure how to approach it and it’s a little tricky. I don’t know if it is a cultural, religious or health thing and I feel like saying the wrong thing could get me in trouble with HR easily. At the same time I feel my team’s pain and I am afraid that if I don’t do anything, one of them is eventually gonna explode and it could get ugly.

So how would you handle something like this?

We are a remote first company with ~350 employees, of these around 100 are operation critical and deal directly with our customers. Several leaders have noticed and increase in reports of “internet instability” from these employees. We have not seen the same pattern from employees on the business side (think FP&A, strategy, marketing…), so we’re suspecting some abuse.

Wondering if others have seen this pattern before, and how have they gone about it. We don’t want to be unfair to those who are legitimately going through difficulties, but cannot tolerate further abuse.

Obs.: Working from the office is not an option, as a company we’d just prefer not to have employees we cannot trust with us.

ETA: reporting “internet instability” allows them to go offline for a few hours without incurring any salary loss.

As a supervisor or manager, we dont really get days off. I had a fun conversation with the district manager and he said he is on call 24/7.

Im just a supervisor, but i catch myself consistently thinking and worrying about work. Thinking about how im goimg to approach a project next week, how im going to set a team member in place. Small, stupid shit that should not consume my weekend.

Do we ever really turn it off? Or am i just not doing it right?

I'm the newest member of staff so this may be where her uncertainty is coming from.

For example today I said 'let's put the heater on its cold', She says no we don't do that it's expensive to run. I said 'it's ok we're all freezing' so I popped it on. She immediately runs to the manager to ask if it's ok, which of course it was. It's always little things like this, she goes over my head for every thing.

The other day I was sitting with her, working, she went to the manager in another room for help with things I could have helped her with immediately. I suggested she could ask me instead but she kept on doing it.

My manager has said she wants my team to come to me first before her and they all do except this one lady.

I need some help with addressing this. Should I talk to her? She's very emotional and I don't want to get her back up.

Big edit!

Thank you all for your helpful responses. It’s brought about a lot of self reflection and ideas on different approaches.

I’ve decided to delete the content from this post down because, while being vague, was specific enough to be an identifier if a person came across it.

Again, I appreciate all of your feedback!

I have a direct report who just freaked out a little bit because we were in an online meeting where I was sharing my screen and my Outlook notifications popped up. On there were out of office notifications from people. This was a closed meeting of just our team. He said it was a huge security risk. This employee has in the past refused to use the group calendar to identify upcoming PTO and will only send me personal out of office notifications that he expects no one else to see. How do you handle this? I think he's being a bit over the top. He keeps talking about need to know and that he learned to control information like this in his military days. I believe his teammates have a need to know whether he is working or not on a given day if they need his assistance with something. This guy is our team IT focal and provides troubleshooting and support for some custom applications that he maintains.

EDIT: I have email set to not pop up a preview when it comes in. The window I was talking about was the reminder window in Outlook which (in general) shows meeting notice titles. I have people send me a calendar notice for vacations and that (along with some other meetings today) was what was seen. EDIT-2: This was out of office notifications for other team members that are out today.

One of my direct reports has 3 kids, and she just had her third 6 months ago. She is so scattered, doesn’t focus on job priorities, is late to meetings or no-shows Today she no showed me for a meeting with no heads up at all. She has great ideas and is very smart, but isn’t able to follow through half the time.

I am not a mom of human children so I am trying to give her grace and flexibility, but at what point do I need to be a little more stringent? Any advice on how to handle this?

EDIT: She just started with our organization in March 2023, and left on maternity leave June-September. She returned in mid September.

UPDATE because people keep posting: meeting went really well. Despite some of your advice, owning up to my own mistakes put her at ease and made her feel like we are a team. We are meeting each Friday to go over her projects and we will break down the steps and go over any roadblocks she’s having. I’ve already seen marked improvement and I’m looking forward to this new chapter. Some of y’all are just cold blooded.

I’ve had some issues with this employee in the past. Her priority is her home and her family (which is good! It should be!) but lately she hasn’t been getting anything done AT ALL (we are hybrid - in office 2 days a week). In April we moved much of her daily, time consuming tasks onto another employee, which theoretically should’ve freed up 2-3 hours per day. I caught on to a decrease in productivity in September and started having her email me a list of everything she’s working on each week. So many weeks have been “not much!” And “same as last week!” The CEO is talking about rescinding WFH bc of 3-4 people in the office who aren’t getting work done. Tomorrow I have to talk with her and put her on a PIP. I know she’s going to be defensive and mean (any time she is criticized she shuts down and gets defensive, no matter how supportively I phrase it). Just looking for support!

To be clear mine is not the type of industry where bonuses are expected. They are giving me and my assistant a bonus for our hard work and excellent product this year.

(I am a golf course superintendent. My number 2 is the “assistant golf course superintendent”. That’s just the nomenclature for our industry)

Large Bonuses are not the norm. They do happen occasionally but they tend to be $250-500 ish with an Xmas card. This one is significantly larger than that.

I worked 22 years to get to this position and I am extremely proud of where I am, but I’m even prouder and more grateful that I am succeeding in this role to the point that the brass sought fit to give me a bonus like this.

Just a gratitude post. That’s all.

As a manager, how do you deal with employees after your CEO post a statement regarding the Israeli/Palestinian conflict? We have team members and friends on both sides. One side now is upset but can not express their opinion without worrying about their jobs. They do not feel safe anymore.
Is ok that the CEO takes a side publicly within the company? This is a very complicated conflict.

I hired him earlier this year. He seemed somewhat normal in the interview and the week after. Then he suddenly became unhinged with me. Sending me very long texts about how I screwed up his schedule (it's parks n rec so there's no pressure to work in the off seasons). He literally went ape sh*t about me talking to him about mistakes to iron out which is something every manager does the 1st month, there were like 5 or 6 mistakes. There's so much more but I'm not gonna keep you guys here. Tbh I've never had this issue with any employee ever because the job is so easy and SO low key. It's a show up if you want to type job. I'm honestly scared of this man.

Here's my predicament. My boss and office manager think he's good enough to tolerate even though they kicked him out of their side of the park (golf course) and sent him back to me (nature park). That I should just deal with him even though he treats me differently than them, keep in mind the golf managers are men and I'm the only female manager in the entire park. I'm 100% positive if I can his a$$ then he's gonna complain to upper mgmt about me and say some nefarious things even though I kept contact with him limited and recorded. I'm pulling out all the stops to make it work but idk if i can do this anymore. I'm 7 months pregnant so I could just get as easily canned by a bunch of male staff even though I've worked this job for 10 years and never had any complaints. I have loads of previous employees and current ones that would defend me but I know what this guy is capable of because I looked him up online and he's got a record of suing people or more specifically, complaining about lady bosses to heads like commissioners. This guy is a freak and I have no idea what to do and I'm scared to make a move. My dad says can him and don't respond to him. Respond to upper mgmt only.

Tldr; mistakenly hired a guy who has a record of complaining about women bosses and my boss thinks I should keep him on and tolerate his terrible behavior.

There is a bad virus going around and many people are calling out multiple days in a row. I'm just curious how others respond to these messages. Do you you keep it short and business toned. Do you include empathetic remarks? Do you include expectation reminders? One of my responses this week was "Thank you for letting me know. Take care of yourself and don't worry about anything going on here."

As a manager, do you spend your personal money on team lunches, gifts, anniversary recognition etc or do you have a budget allocated by the company?

I have a fully remote job and a huge problem. I get out of bed, get ready for work, and then go sit at my desk in the home office. The trouble starts right after. I don't take breaks. I don't move. I forget about lunch. I forget about staying hydrated. Hours pass me by and before I know it, its time for dinner.

I don't get distracted at all. I keep hearing about how people get distracted when they work remotely. I have the exact opposite problem. My focus is insane. So much so that it's probably a bad thing. And I don't know what to do about it. Nothing works.

It's getting worse now that my responsibilities are increasing and my team is getting bigger. I am meeting heavy. So I just go from meeting to meeting and the whole day passes me by. Then I feel bad about not doing the work and I do some deep work once the day is over and the meetings are done.

I am fairly certain if I got a health check done, it would turn out real bad.

Has anyone been in this situation? How did you get out of it? How did you prioritize yourself, your health? I have considered an office job but I don't want to give up remote work.

More context: I live in a very poor country and there isn't much to do here if I go outside. Most of the people I know have immigrated to other places. The air quality is very poor. My country isn't a safe space for women. The economy is crippled. There are a lot of external stressors and work keeps me sane and happy.

Hello,

This is a post on behalf of my wife, she is stressed because of this situation as explained in the title.

She's a fairly new manager and doesn't want to ask HR just yet for advice as she doesn't want to throw said employee under the bus.

What would you do? What's the best way to bring up the subject with the team member?

Should she speak to HR anyway, go in hard on them or bring it up sensitively in case there's a good reason?

Some extra context if helpful:

It was Friday, WFH day.

She knows she did no work as her documents were not - updated at all all day and hadn't logged into teams.

I am a team manager and last month one of my engineers handed in his notice 3 months early (leaving on the 31st Dec). He’s started to lose interest in work and not complete mandatory pieces of work. He’s also started to refuse to do some tasks. How should I manage this, is it worth going down the disciplinary route or stick it out for another 2 months? For context, he’s been in the company for 20+ yrs, I’m not allowed to give him gardening leave, he’s always been hard to work with.

Hey guys. First time post here. We just started a new person. He's been here about 3 weeks. Everyone in the team was saying how this person was slow and didn't understand what was going on from day one. It is a relatively simple position but I've never trained or seen anyone here who became an expert in this position in 3 weeks time.

I have been receiving negative feedback from multiple team members on their performance so today I decided to work alongside him hands on to see what they are capable of. They managed to keep up pace and performed 100% satisfactorily. Unfortunately, the 2 people above me are dead set on canning him tomorrow as much as I tried to get him to keep him.

It's just hard for me to let this go as they are still new to the position that I was awful at for a longer period of time but was given the chance to stay on and it landed me in the position I'm in today. It's also almost Christmas. I genuinely believe that we will be letting go of a dedicated and hard working person. We are slower and payroll is high but there are other circumstances that can be mitigated that I brought up that were brushed off.

Is there anyone that can talk me through this situation because I feel very muddled right now about it all. Thank you.

I want to preface this by noting I am not a manager.

My general manager (me -> team lead -> manager -> gm) wants 1 on 1s with ICs (individual contributor) quarterly. I have absolutely zero interest in meeting with this man. I have nothing to talk about and neither does he. I hate having to fake interest just to get by and I am not interested in climbing the ladder at this company. I want to do my work and that’s it.

My question: do you continue to have 1 on 1s with those who are uninterested? If so, why?

(This is considering they perform well and have not had any negative interactions with colleagues. They are great at their job, they just don’t want to put on a fake smile with managers who really do not care and are doing 1 on 1s to just check the box. It’s so fake.).

ETA: I’m getting downvoted to hell and I don’t know why. I think the downvotes clearly represent the problems I’ve had with leadership at my current company. AND nobody is answering my question. I wonder how this translates to the feedback y’all provide your teams.

ETA2: Thank you for your replies. They’ve been insightful. Especially considering the general consensus is I’m a bad employee. It’s enlightening to learn this because if I were a manager, I would feel differently about a subordinate in my position.

Curious to hear some wisdom that keeps you sharp/encouraged

My employee gifted me unknown to me a $10 Starbucks e-gift card with a note showing appreciation to me as a boss.

What is your policy on accepting gifts?

My workplace does not have a clear policy but in all other aspects has been very strict about workplace relations. I’m trying to think of the right balance of acknowledging and appreciating the thought without accepting the monetary side to it.

Initially I reviewed and do not see a way to deny the e-gift so my thoughts were to share a message of appreciation but encourage the employee to buy herself coffee and send an equal gift card back to her to reimburse?

I feel that sometimes my team will ask me a question that I wouldn't know the answer and I don't want to feel like I'm not a good manager for the team. It hasn't happened yet but I think it will happen in some point.

Hi All!

As we transition into the colder months in the north i find myself catching a chill every so often.

To combat this ill randomly do som assisted pushups off the desk ir squats within my cube.

What's a managers perspective on this?

Is it unprofessional in an office setting?

TL;DR I had two employees shout and swear at me in an open plan office, then I lost my temper and shouted back at them. One of them walked away and said “if you’ve got a problem we can settle this in the parking lot” to which I said “ok, let’s go” and I marched towards him. I should point out that I didn’t touch or threaten anyone.

At this point, the head of HR pops in and tells me to walk away and calms the situation. I’m now being investigated for aggressive behaviour and have been asked to work from home for the past two weeks.

Long version: I’ve been in this role just under a year. Before starting I was told directly by many many people that two of the people working for me are going to be really hard work. They’ve been an issue at the company for the past five years and one of them was the manager previously but was so bad, they demoted him.

The first three months I was there, everything goes well. The team (of four at the time) are really nice to me. I know that these two are going to be trouble so I come in and take it all with a pinch of salt. There are always two sides to a story. Let’s find out what really happened (from their point of view).

So the guy that was the manager is notorious for being hard headed and digging his heels in whenever he disagrees with a decision. Quite often when asked to do something he will give one sentence answer or say something like “it won’t work”. When pressed, “what do you mean by that?” He will say something like “physics” or “because”. Which is frustrating in itself and he may even be right but it gives no opportunities for others to learn.

The other guy is young and volatile. Kicks off at the drop of a hat. Shouts, swears and storms off all the time.

With both of them I’ve spoken to them politely about their attitude and told them to reign it in. The day before the incident I lost my temper with them and walked away to come back again a minute later and tell them that this behaviour isn’t ok and that they need to let me speak and not speak over me. They seemed receptive.

Later that day, the young volatile one is emailing one of the directors (my boss) and getting worked up. Later on that director emails me and asks for a meeting the following morning. He’s not happy.

The following day (the day of the incident) the two regulars are kicking off that someone lower than them is asking what they’re working on. I tell them that anyone should be able to speak to you and ask you what you’re doing. Both of you have responded in an unacceptable way. I then leave and have a meeting with two directors to discuss the behaviour of these two, separate of this incident.

I then get dragged into another 2 hour meeting and finally come back to the office and tell the guys that we will be moving the tables around for the new guy in five minutes. To which I get the reply “I don’t think so”. So I’m obviously perplexed. What’s going on here? Is this an unreasonable request? So I walk over to him and ask, “what’s the matter? Do you want ten minutes?” “I’m going for lunch in a minute so it’s not going to happen” “Actually, this is only going to take five minutes. You can do this first and then go for lunch” “Who the fuck do you think you are? You can’t tell me when I can go for lunch” - I can. It’s literally my job. “ excuse me? Who the fuck do you think you are? I can tell you to go for lunch and you can go after we’ve moved the tables”

Cue the ex-manager piping up “Don’t talk to him like that”

I think he’s talking to the guy that’s been kicking off “Thank you” “No not you him. Don’t fucking talk like that to him. Who the fuck do you think you are”

I’m completely shocked. Can’t believe what I’m hearing.

I say to them both “right, you and you in that office now”

Both start shouting and screaming. One walks off.

I say, in a very aggressive voice “where the fuck do you think you’re going? Get the fuck back here”

He then offers me for a fight in the parking lot. Hr intervenes.

We stay at work together for two full days before I’m asked to work from home.

I shouldn’t have lost my temper. I’m really embarrassed it’s got this far.

What would you do?

How do I deal with employees asking so many questions?

My ADHD brain is difficult enough and I can’t get my own work done because as soon as I get into a Flowstate, somebody interrupts me

9 out of 10 times someone could’ve just looked up what they needed to in the instructions. We have a lot of documentation.

I get so frustrated and then I start getting rude. Like I’m about to send people home if they keep asking me stuff. But I know that is not the right way to do it.

Some ideas come to mind such as having designated times of day, where people can ask questions. Otherwise save it till tomorrow. Alternatively people can always email me and throughout the day if I can answer it I will.

But it’s getting to the point where my boss is on my ass for things I’m not getting done because of so many interruptions throughout the day

It’s not about the five minutes. It takes to answer the question. It’s about the 25 minutes. It takes me to get back in the mindset of what I was working on.

Before I know what the day is gone, and I’ve got next to nothing done

I’ve hit my 14 month of being a manager and I’m really starting to hate it. Maybe I’m just not cut out for it. I’m too much of a people pleaser, and I’m learning you can’t please everyone. I understand my employees complaints and perspectives, having still doing their job tasks because of staffing, but I also understand that these fixes will never happen overnight; most problems stem from other departments. I meet with these departments and point out the issues and try to work on processes to improve but at the end of the day I don’t manage those other employees, I can only do so much. Maybe I’m not listening hard enough. When people complain about the workload I can have sympathy but for some I can only do so much because objectively, the workload is undeniably manageable from anyone’s perspective. I make guidelines and resources and offer advice on how to manage their time better, but I can’t force people to use that advice or listen to it. I don’t want to do this anymore, I want to demote myself but I don’t know if that’s an option. I want to quit but the job market is awful and I honestly don’t know what I want to do with my life. I don’t have the patience to get people to understand the politics of what goes on and that I only have so much of a say in things. I used to have the same complaints as them honestly, and now that I’m in this position I see how much it sucks. Just needed to vent somewhere.

Just switched to a role where I'm still at a similar level on the org chart, but in a niche technical role and no longer managing a team. I'm loving it. No headaches, don't have work following me home. I just do my tasks and go home, and I'm making better money than I was running a team.

I know something this good can't last forever, and the only way up from here is back into a leadership role, but I'm loving life at the moment.

Anyone else ever step away from leading a team for a period of time? Did you go back?

I have an entry level associate who has been in significant training mode for over a year now, i.e. WAY too long. They just don't get it. I've tried seriously everything and the past several months have been on an informal PIP (can'tdocument with HR until the new year annual reviews come around, at Sr Managers direction). See previous post for details. I finally want to throw in the towel so I go to my senior manager with a mountain of evidence including multiple instances of not working at all, falling asleep at work, and the sheer amount of time wasted by me and peers correcting, reteaching, and making up for the shoddy work product. Senior manager has been aware of this ongoing situation for a while now. They have ultimate hire/fire authority, not me. They say "we can't fire him right now, just make the best of it."

What would you do here? Keep trying to teach the person? Back off and let them flounder knowing that's more work for you to pick up the slack? I'm kind of angry at the Sr because allowing this to continue is like letting the associate walk all over my helping hand and saying it's ok.

I hired an employee who talked a good talk during the interview, and seemed like she would be a good addition to the team. However 4 weeks in and she’s just not catching on and has zero sense of urgency in her work.

I know she isn’t going to work out, would you continue training her while looking for a replacement or let her go? I feel like training is a waste of my trainers time but also feel bad that I have to fire her after 4 weeks.

I manage a large team across two offices. I am located in the first office, this employee is located in the second. Most of my team are full-time permanent. The person in question is a contractor who is paid hourly. And weekly hours fluctuate depending on need.

When I took on this role, the employee entered the time card with different times on each day. Each day was somewhat unique which would reflect the natural day due to the work the employee was doing. I.E. take an earlier lunch one day, or finishing late one day and leaving early another, etc.

It might be helpful to note that the previous manager worked at the second location as well, in the same office area as this employee and would see when the employee was in or out. I took over when the last manager went on maternity leave.

Over the course of a few months the employee slowly changed their time card to working exact same hours every day, to the max hours per week that the contract allows. For a time it fit in with our busy period so I didn’t question it. We’re no longer that busy but the time card reads the same.

A few weeks ago, another team member absently mentioned this employee came in late on Monday. I asked (subtly) when they normally arrive, and it was 1.5 hours after they put on their time card. I asked when they usually leave and it was 30 mins before whats on the time card. Coming in “late” that Monday was starting at 1pm, the employee wrote 8:00am that day.

I don’t have any way to prove these discrepancies. I’m not there to see it myself.

Any advice for dealing with this situation? How do I gain evidence on this employee without involving any other team members?

Last night I posted on here about too much negativity from non managers. It resulted in lots of comments, many of which urged me to listen to more feedback. So, with that in mind, I would like to know, what do you want to see your manager do more? I welcome feedback from employees at all levels. Let’s strive for positive changes to the workplace!

I see a lot of folks giving advice here and in many cases are assuming that they are a good manager. How do you really know? You can't base it just off company success I've seen horrible work cultures still be business successful. I also don't think you can strictly base it off employee happiness because employees could be happy even if a business is failing ie you're not pushing them to do their jobs or them walking all over you.

So how can one determine if their walking the line and doing what they should be without letting things get to one extreme or the other?

One of my reports has taken too much time off lately (we don’t have accrued PTO, it’s “flexible” based on managers discretion) and it’s going to effect his customer work eventually. I denied his request for June 9 because he JUST got back from a 2 week vacation.

He told me it’s an important religious holiday to which I said “okay, let me review again” — but now I feel like he’s bs-ing me. I can’t find a single religious holiday for June 9 or around it. I don’t want it to be uncomfortable or over stepping by asking “which holiday”..

What would you do?

ETA: he’s not the best employee- which is why I think this may be a load of bs. However, I think I agree with everyone that I’ll just approve it and use output/metrics regarding performance. Thank you all for the advice!

ETA2: it’s been approved. To those who are criticizing my management, just providing additional clarification (not that I need to anyways) but the employees numbers are starting to be at risk due to abusing the flexible PTO. Their performance is being addressed. I denied the PTO initially but then that’s when the employee came back and said it’s for an “important religious holiday”. The whole situation is sketch, which is why I wanted to ask other managers what their thoughts were. I always approve time off for my team and remind them to when I see them working more or it’s been too long since they’ve taken it. I never ask anyone about their time off requests except if they needed anything or additional support when the employee themselves mentioned it’s for a medical reason/bereavement.

As leaders we have been aware of an impending layoff.

I found out that my boss will not have a role once this occurs. It sounds like they will have me step into his role as they do some consolidation.

I am torn on what to say to him if anything. I have made references to anything can happen and we should get our resumes ready (which I have).

But he won’t listen and wants to argue about that.

Which is a major factor in the decision to let him go.

Once he decides he is right about something, no amount of new data will move that position.

With that said, I would want to know. This would give me some time to prepare and start the process of finding something new.

He is a decent guy, who for the most part has been decent to me.

The issue is he wouldn’t accept the reality and would most likely cause me issues. I could see him raising a big stink about news he shouldn’t know anything about.

With that said I don’t trust any of these companies. We are “family” until they can get .000001 a share by laying off a bunch of people. See that just business, when they need you to work extra hours, weekends or holidays that’s when you family.

Right now my plan is to keep my mouth shut. Obviously I’m struggling with that decision.

Update:

First thank you everyone for the advice, perspectives and personal stories.

For me this was one of those gut check moments.

My plan is firm in not sharing any details with him. It is to much of a risk based on how he would respond.

You have to look out for #1 without stepping in #2.

Update #1: The timing was pushed, but he was let go today. The new org chart reflects what was explained to me.

Questions:
1.) Should I reach out to him? Not sure what to say if I did. Other than, I'm sorry. 2.) If a company fires you before Christmas are you still considered family?

I work in a somewhat buttoned up office environment and Im one of the most buttoned up distant managers. I will be doing my first after hours social gathering as a manager with a small group of guys who I assume are all heterosexual. I will be the highest ranked person there and 2 out of the 7 others will be my direct reports. My wife said I shouldnt drink during this outing as an abundance of caution and Im not even a big drinker to begin with but I thought it was an opportunity to kind of break the mold of this uptight manager persona and show Im like one of the guys as well.

So Im curious at what point does drinking with colleagues and direct reports become inappropriate.

I have a co-worker who is pleasant but

he comes in to the office -maybe- once a week- and we are supposed to be in the office 4x a week.

he's a writer and can only write about 3 paragraphs a day. With ChatGPT this seems ridiculous.

all of his work needs to be edited

most of the writers are also good editors. However, he never seems to find any mistakes when we are all reviewing large documents.

he can only work on one thing at a time. If he is given more than 1 or 2 projects he freaks out.

he never has any ideas or initiative or is pro-active. He just waits for managers to tell him what to do.

he has a general grumpy and negative attitude about work and the company (not unreasonable, but on top of everything else his attitude is annoying)

I am a director in the department, but he is not under my direction. Neither his boss nor our manager are able (or willing?) to confront him or deal with the issue.
Maybe I should mind my own business? It doesn't seem fair.

What would you do?

LOL, as The title says

One of my employees has this constant urge to bitch, compare herself to others and generally look at things in a way that is toxic. Much of what she bitches about is true…but what’s the point of dwelling on negativity so much?

To be perfectly honest, she is a fantastic worker…gets shit done, like no other. The top 3 people in our company(myself included) go to her with many questions and problems. She has a steal trap memory and learns stuff fast. I’d add that I genu like her as a person. She owns her job, has a good sense of humor, etc

I’ve done a pretty good job of raising her compensation in the five yrs since she was hired . Started at 33k a yr…currently 70K as she has learned and taken on more duties. Always go to bat for her in any way I can

Im kind of at a loss. She’s my go to problem solver…takes on responsibilities in a way that I don’t need to be there.….Just can’t get her to stop bitching. I think she enjoys it. Lol. I leave memes laying around my office ..hoping she’ll get the hint “Comparison is the thief of joy” We’ll discuss the meme…and she seems to agree…yet. Just likes to bitch

Anyone have any methods of turning a person like this. It doesn’t even bother me that much, as I’m the ops manager and am free to come and go as I wish. I just feel it’s gotta be bad for her health

As an outside hire I am being extremely monitored by corporate. I never met the old manager but I love her. She left things very organized for me and left notes. But there were things she strait up was doing for the team or letting them get away with that was not in line with company policy. Because of corporate monitoring me, they also have found many of these things.

At this time I am allowed very few choices of my own. I feel like a mouth for someone else to talk out of. I've had multiple of my own ideas for slowing down or allowing me to take on some of this work turned down because "they can't learn that they don't have to do parts of their job, or that you'll just do things they dont want to do for them"

It's already difficult being a new manager and outside hire but I'm also being forced to come in and immidately implement change after change. And some of these changes needed to happen but stress levels are very high right now.

I asked what will happen if the team just doesn't do what we are asking, which seems to be part of what's happening. And it sounded like disciplinary action and potentially firing in the future was a possibility.

I feel like im fighting so hard for these girls but they absolutely hate my guts and that's such an awful feeling. But at the same time there are some things that really aren't acceptable, like coming in an hour late without saying anything to management. and others that are just the company nit-picking, but with the amount of monitoring and coaching I am under at the moment I have to treat them both basically the same. I don't know how to undo the damage but it's like I sit near them and there is just rage seething from them. One of the girls actually had to leave when I sat down and be comforted she hates my presence so much.

The employee requested that I speak with the other employee about it, without revealing that she requested me to talk to the other employee about it

I became a manager about a year ago, and one of my employees recently lost her father. He had been in hospice for about a year, so we all knew it would eventually occur. She had to leave the country to attend to things and has been working remotely for almost a month, which is 100% fine. When she returns, is it acceptable to buy flowers and a card, or how would you address it so you don't come off cold?

Edit: Thank you all for the responses. In case anyone else responds, my team is me, and three others. We are hidden within the company, so there's not a lot of interaction with other departments. We work hybrid right now, and I'm not sure if she's back yet. While I am the "manager," all HR stuff is handled by our VP. I'll double-check with the VP, but I'll at least get the employee a card.

Exactly as it sounds - - I manage a small team. There's this one guy who is particularly incompetent, after so much time invested in his training and up-skilling including personal sessions from myself and projects almost going belly-up I have yet to see positive results.

I've all but discouraged him from the field we work in, as it requires a lot of critical thinking which I have never seen from him.

Now, he's expressed wanting to leave and is asking me to be a reference for the future companies he'll interview with. I don't think I can lie because if asked, I would absolutely not hire him again. What would you recommend doing?

I promoted several years ago, I supervise 16 people. I do all sorts of supervisor things and I enjoy very little of it.

I’m good at tasks and projects, I despise managing people. I’d like to go back to my old role, but I expect that’s uncommon.

I have an idea in mind that deviates slightly from an existing plan. It would restructure my three work groups, creating a position I could demote into. Financially, I don’t mind the pay decrease.

Because of the restructuring, I would solve a major staffing issue while decreasing the budget by about $15k.

If my job were vacant, someone likely would’ve had this same idea. But I expect my willingness will be a curve ball for the top dogs.

I just hate it and I’m looking for reassurance or warnings to heed, whatever your experiences may be.

My company is 100% remote. We are looking for ways to boost morale, promote employee retention, and honestly break up the monotony and isolation that working remotely sometimes creates. What are some budget friendly remote team building ideas I can steal from yall? All input welcome!

ETA: Thank you everyone for your input. It has been very helpful and eye opening. I now have the pleasure of compiling the data for presentation. I never thought I'd have a job where I'd make a spreadsheet from a reddit post but here we are!

I had team member setup a meeting with me. They’ve been with the company for just over a year. They told me that they got a job offer at a different company with a salary increase. They continued to say that they love working at our company and they would be willing to stay should we match the offer. I said I’ll think about it and get back to them. I discussed it with my team and agreed that you can’t get a raise without an increase in responsibility, you’re also clearly not as happy if you’re looking for another job. So we decided that we are not going to counter offer.

I met with the team member again today, informed them that we won’t counter offer, but I understand that they should do what’s the best for them, they can just let me know what they decide. And then immediately, they said they would rather stay.

So I’m just confused as to whether they had another offer at all? If not, why would they take this approach to get a raise? Or if they did get the offer, but they weren’t going to accept, why tell your manager about it.

People confuse me 🤦🏾

EDIT: all team members get an annual raise of 7-10%. This request was in addition to that.

As the moderation team of managers, we have concerns about recent changes to Reddit.

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem for users: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

Accordingly, the moderation team of mamagers is declaring its opposition to this API pricing change, and will be shutting down on June 12th. This shut down will be open ended for now; the subreddit will be closed until the tools to provide effective moderation are available once more.

I just rejected a job offer that offered greater responsibility, a better title, exposure to leadership, and considerably more pay (60% jump). I made this decision because of the following reasons:

Risk: the company was small and running because of leads through the founders network alone, and I couldn't find much about them online

Smaller team: They didn't have much of a marketing team. I'd be going from managing a larger team that is constantly growing to a tiny team full of part-timers and freelancers.

Lifestyle shift: I'd be going from a fully remote job to a hybrid (3 days a week in office) one, and giving up unlimited PTO that I regularly utilize for 15 annual leaves only.

Leadership: the co-founders didn't seem to know a lot about marketing, and I felt that it'd be a constant struggle to get anything done the right way.

I am also happy at my current workplace and expecting a promotion at the end of the year.

I hope I made the right decision. It was a very tough choice. It would have been amazing to have that title and pay, and run the marketing department as a director rather than a manager, and get to work directly with the co-founders and grow the company.

I hope a better fit comes along. Good pay and title and lots more responsibility, but in a well-established organization where I get to manage a larger team remotely and enjoy 1 to 2 week leaves every 3 to 4 months.

Have you ever had to make such a tough call? Would you have picked the pay jump?

This is a long story but I'm going to try to keep it shortish.

I have this employee that's been with the company for about 18 years. She's moved around a lot from department to department and is currently in my department and doing a specific job for me.

She does a very good job for me and rarely makes any mistakes. However, she's a "yes person" AND a people pleaser and everybody knows it. People outside of my department will ask her to do something that is outside of her job description and she'll do it, reluctantly but she'll do it.

I've had conversations with my boss about the other departments leaders going directly to this employee and my boss told me to let her handle it. So I let this portion go.

I've told my employee that these things are not part of her job description and that if someone asks her to do something she needs to either say no or say I have to check with my manager. In which case I'd review whatever it is and see if she has the bandwidth to do it.

She's done a good job of doing these things previously. However, we have this new issue within our company that she has a lot of knowledge in.

This new issue is a big issue and I have several millions of dollars tied up in this issue. We've recruited her to assist in figuring out what's going on and she's done a fantastic job. However, she's going around me when it comes to doing things for this issue.

Recently, she sent me a message on a WFH day (Hybrid schedule, MWF from Home, T/TH from Office) and told me that she was going to go up to ABC Department (the one with the issue) on Monday and wanted to know if she should use PTO or Sick time for it.

I asked her who told her to go up to the ABC department and she said no one, the other lady was feeling nervous about going so she wanted to go also.

I told her No, she will not be going up to ABC Department. She questioned me about it and asked why. I explained to her that ABC department is a major issue, however this portion of it (that she wanted to help with) is not our responsibility and she should allow the other employee to do her job.

Also, that it sets the precedent that she will continue to show up for ABC department and both me and my boss are not ok with that.

Then she told me "ok I'll let them know I won't be able to make it." She'd already committed to it prior to ever talking to me about it. That irritated me. It shows a lack of respect for me as her boss and that's the portion I want to approach.

Today, she irritated the F out of me again. We had our standard 1 on 1 this morning and she just flat out told me "I'm going to do this for ABC Department" and I was like NO. I don't want you to do that, who told you to do that? She was like well it was decided by XYZ and WUV Person on such and such day that I would do this thing.

So I went and looked at the documentation for that day, and no it clearly states that the other employee would do it. Anyway, I'm going to write a TLDR.

TLDR:

Employee is a yes person and people pleaser. Everybody knows it. She goes around me (her boss) and does things for other departments that cut into her time on my department. She's a good employee and other than speaking with her about it, I'm not permitted to do anything else with her as in write her up or anything like that. I've spoken with her about this several times and given her several strategies "Out". She uses them sometimes but continues to go around me with some things. What would you do? How would you approach this?

Every time I talk to her about something even remotely intense she seems like she's going to cry so I have to be very very gentle with how I approach this.

I started a new job last week (standard admin office), and on Monday my manager had us all do a "Dancercise" to music for ten minutes. Everyone was really into it but I felt awkward, so I kinda just stood there making the odd arm/leg movement.

After, my manager called me to one side and told me she was annoyed at me not joining in properly. Also they do that every Monday morning, and if she doesn't see an improvement next week then "we're going to have words" according to her.

Obviously, a bunch of us are stuck in the same cycle of needing to work to live, but hating our lives because of it. If we can't smash the system entirely all at once, something that we can do is normalize anti-work practices in the workplace. Here are some of the things I do with my team that have helped us all immensely as we combat the need to work to survive:

I don't ever ask my employees why they are calling out. I don't make them feel guilty, I don't ask them if they're sure they can't make it in, I just tell them to enjoy their day off and ask which type of PTO they'd like applied to their timecard. It's none of my business and I HATE when managers do this. Their time is their time, not mine. I don't have any right to ask why they can't make it to work.

I never deny time-off requests. Ever. It's disgusting. Working for the system should never, ever be prioritized over somebody's personal life. If they "didn't request off soon enough," don't care. They deserve the time off and we'll make it work in their absence.

I go to bat for my employees. If my supervisor notices something about my team that he isn't satisfied with, I blame it on myself and address the problem with my team. I shield them from all upper level discipline by taking accountability for any shortcomings. If my team isn't performing the job correctly, that is my fault for not giving them the tools to do so, and I make sure that they're protected from any scrutiny because of it.

I don't throw them pizza parties to show my appreciation. Instead, I help them find ways to utilize their PTO to get the most time off without getting themselves into attendance trouble. People don't want pizza, they want to not have to work. I find creative ways to help them do this.

If somebody is struggling for money, I brainstorm ideas with them to either get more hours, find resources outside of work to help them in the meantime, or just generally support them in any way that I can. Example, if somebody has no money to put gas in their car, I'll justify to my bosses calling them a cab to get to work. If somebody has a bunch of expenses coming up and needs overtime, I create projects and ways for them to get the hours that they need so they can make ends meet.

I don't give a fuck if they're a few minutes late. The micro-management of every minute of people's days is gross and we should all be working to end that.

If they're having a mental health crises at work, but they don't have the hours to go home and take the time off, I find something for them to do at work that's calming where they can run out the clock, still get paid, but not be overwhelmed. For example, I had somebody "organize the closet" and just let her go sit in there on her phone until she felt a little better.

I help them help each other. I help them plan out the month and switch shifts with each other so that everyone can get a long weekend, a four day week, XYZ. We work as a team to allow us all to take the most time off.

My employees don't make enough money, and I make sure that they know that. I constantly empower them to never equate their skill sets with the wage that our corporate overlords gave to us. I remind them constantly that they're worth so much more, that who they are as a person is valuable and should never be quantified by a dollar sign, and that our wages are the result of a shitty, unfair system, not the result of a lack of skills or work ethic. And I constantly fight for higher wages for them at every chance I get.

I do everything I can to make sure that I'm approachable. I don't want anyone ever to be afraid to ask a question, to "bother me," to need extra help- I'm open and inviting, I have an open-door policy and I encourage feedback from every level.

I constantly remind them that I'm not a manager because I'm smarter, better, more equipped- I'm a manager because they needed one and I was the next in line. I encourage them to never look at things in a hierarchical fashion. Just because they're on the lowest rung of our employment ladder and get paid the least, does not mean anything negative about their abilities. I constantly remind them that they work harder than most people at a director or executive level, and that it's only because we live in a sick society that their wages don't reflect that.

I encourage professional development. I hire people with no experience, with limited computer skills, with rough reading or writing skills, and I teach them the job itself along with transferable skills that they can use elsewhere like how to work with Microsoft Office or Excel. I never equate somebody's experience to how well they might do the job, I only ever look at their attitude and willingness to be apart of the team. The best employees I have are the ones who have lived experience of homelessness or addiction and who had no experience in the field when I hired them.

I foster a sense of community. I always plan events for us outside of work that are free and stress relieving. I work to get our schedule covered completely so that we can all do things together as a team and not have to worry about getting shifts covered.

I talk shit about the evils of capitalism all the time and remind them that their intrinsic value does not come from their work output, but from who they are as people.

I offhandedly criticize or voice confusion towards my colleagues who don't follow these ideas or use their management status to be punitive. For example, if somebody is proud to have denied a time-off request or somebody is angry that their employees are calling out, I'll shift the narrative to refocus the attention on perhaps a shortcoming of their management skills, rather than on the "laziness" of our employees. "Oh, you denied an employee's time off request? That's okay, one day you'll learn how to run your program even if one person takes a vacation. I know it can be difficult, but you'll learn!" or "You're upset that an employee called out for the third time in a row? Jeez, what's going on in your program that makes people not want to come to work? Sounds like you need to address your work environment, not their work ethic."

I'm just overall not a dick. I treat them like people, I give them as much autonomy as humanly possible over their time and schedules, I support them, I help them work through challenges rather than penalize them. I talk about everything they are, rather than bringing their attention to the things they aren't.

These are all temporary solutions, but by normalizing this behavior, I've seen a huge shift in the morale of the staff not only in the program that I manage, but in others as well. If you just start to change the narrative and the status quo, and if you do it with enough confidence, people follow suit. Since my implementation of some of these things, policies have started to shift, staff's attitude has started to shift, they're starting to demand what they deserve, to take back control, and it's fucking beautiful.

Anyway. I just want people to know that change is possible and if you're in any way responsible for a team of people, you can do little things that can make a HUGE difference in your staff's lives and your own. It's not a perfect solution, but it's something. I think any of us that are anti-work but are in positions of "authority" if we work together, we can start demonizing the pro-work tropes of feeling guilty for calling out, of our wage equating to our worth, of managers needing to be dickheads and authoritative- none of it has to be true. And we can change it little by little if we all do it collectively. Let's normalize anti-work work. Fuck work.

PS- I'm aware that I'm lucky enough to work in a place where I have some freedom to manage how I'd like, I understand that isn't the same for everyone. But if you have any autonomy in your management practices, use it to stop this disgusting cycle we were born into. Please.

Hi All,

I'm a new manager in a small office and the accounts manager calls anyone who creates the slightest inconvenience stupid, dumb, moron etc straight off the bat.

I really don't appreciate it, any thoughts on how I can communicate this to them without creating a huge issue?

For context, I'm not her manager but will likely to be so in time. The general manager is a good guy but unlikely to raise this with her. We don't have HR

Thank you

I am finding a trend where salaried employees are "forgetting" to add PTO/sick time to their payroll when they are out for a day. This has happened with at least 4 senior team members in the last quarter. Most of these team members have a large bank of time due to their seniority so there shouldnt be a fear of running out of paid time off but they do tend to be the most frequently out of the office relative to their peers (out for a day at least every 2-3 weeks). Since we dont require salaried employees to clock in/out, perhaps its not easy to remember to log PTO/Sick when you are not in? Has anyone had this issue with salaried employees and found an effective process or system for ensuring time off gets submitted?

ETA: So many helpful responses and ideas. Additional Info - You can roll 2 weeks annually (most receive 6-7 weeks annually) so we end up with a lot of people trying to "burn it" at the end and taking large unexpected amounts of time off in a short period which is painful for the team members who rely on them. Best solutions seem to be either requiring time to be submitted before being taken OR moving to an unlimited model to avoid a formal submission system all together (maybe just manage through a shared calendar, etc)

Hey everyone. I'm making this post because right now I don't know how to move forward. I'm fairly new to a leadership position. I was recently promoted, so I'm essentially middle management, and my previous job was my first leadership role - so, the only models I've had for management techniques (aside from my experience as a non-leadership staff member) has been within this small team.

I currently have a small team who I manage, and from all feedback I've been given and/or the vibe of the regular coaching meetings I have with my team, I seem to be liked well enough. However, we have a newer employee who seems to have an issue with me or my management style, and I'm not really sure how to fix the problem or where my responsibility to fix it stops and the employee's begins.

Overall, this employee is an extremely enthusiastic, good-natured, energetic and positive person - which is also what throws me for a loop! However, starting even during their training - which I oversaw - they seemed not to receive constructive criticism well. Towards the end of our training process, this employee was completing some work that was deviating quite problematically from what they had been taught throughout their training, and they were demonstrating a lack of attention to/understanding of pretty basic information that they should have known. At that time, I did say to that employee that I expected them to know this information by this stage, and brought up some of the performance issues I had seen in their aforementioned work. During this particular interaction, though I can say with certainty that I was never unprofessional or unkind, I know that I was a little terser than I usually am, and the employee picked up on that. I made sure to apologise for my delivery of their coaching at that time, and reiterated the things I needed them to work on. Their reaction to this feedback before that acknowledgement from me that I could have been a little gentler in my delivery, was quite emotional and reactionary. It alarmed me a little bit, how quickly and easily this employee became defensive when, again, my delivery of this feedback may not have been my usual sunshine-and-rainbows, but was well within the bounds of respectful and professional. By the end of that conversation, it seemed like we'd worked it out: I'd made the commitment to be more mindful of my tone, the new employee had explained some of the reasons behind their emotional reaction, and we'd come to a seemingly-positive agreement.

Clearly, however, that was not the case. In the majority of our interactions, this employee and I are friendly and have very pleasant chats - however recently I have had to deliver some constructive criticism again, and it did not go over well. This time around, I was extremely careful to be very gentle, to be extra kind and friendly, and to make sure I was communicating this in a positive and upbeat tone. The employee immediately became shut down and argumentative.

I offered that it's totally okay for the two of us to disagree, and that I'm in no way intending to criticise them as a person. I suggested that the employee review their work with this feedback in mind, to see if they could see what I see - and if not, to let me know that they disagree with my assessment, and I would be more than happy to talk about it further and definitely want to hear their thought processes and opinions. The employee simply refused to do this. I suggested it gently again, and again they refused. I let it go at that time because, given their reaction to our last conversation like this, I really didn't want to negate all the ground I thought we'd made up since then. I brought the interaction up with my superiors during our next conversation, and made it known (not for the first time) that the employee seems to have an issue with taking negative feedback - at least when I deliver it - and meets that feedback with responses and attitudes that I think are a little unprofessional/inappropriate.

I've recently heard that this employee is considering leaving the role. They've not said that it is directly related to me: they've quoted a difference in pay from their previous role as a stressor for them, also. But they have noted that they don't think they belong here, that they don't feel appreciated, and that there's no "place" for them in this team. These kinds of comments echo the employee's response to the feedback I had to give them recently - namely that this feed back "essentially means you don't want me to be myself" - so I'm fairly sure that these conversations are the root cause.

Our team is so small with such a big workload, and my superior's love this employee. I don't love their work quite as much, but I do value them and their contribution to the team, and I'd be heartbroken to know that someone left a role because of me.

I want to rectify the situation, and of course I want this employee to be happy in their job. But I also know that receiving feedback is a critical element in our team culture, and looking back on all of my interactions with this person I truly don't know what else I could have done to deliver that feedback any more compassionately.

Maybe this is just venting, but I guess I'm also hoping for some advice/perspectives/reassurance from more experienced leaders outside of my tiny bubble.

Sometimes I get employment verification requests for people who have never worked at the company. I've looked through records and zilch.

Why do people do this?

How should these requests be handled?

I was recently promoted to a management position, and will now supervise some people who were once equals. Most are thrilled about it, as many of the changes I’m thinking about directly benefit them to reduce workloads. I’ve expressed this, and how this is good for all of us, but one coworker in particular is visibly unhappy about it and stayed silent during the announcement. I was most qualified for the promotion, and genuinely earned it, but I’m new to management.

Apart from keeping lines of communication open and honest, what else can I do from my side? Leave it alone unless there’s a problem? I don’t need to be liked, but we all do need to work together.

Edit: thank you for the various comments and advice. It’s all helpful. This is new waters for me to navigate and I appreciate it.

Today I have to perform a RIF on 25% of my division.

The employees did nothing wrong. Yet today I will fire them because of market changes for our key customers that came fast and outside our control.

We did not allow bloat. We did not keep underperformers on staff. We did not hire with abandon. We ran lean and agile, but even still we could not absorb what is happening.

As a leader this is the worst day. The absolute fucking worst. There are few things in the world I hate as much as firing a good person.

Only other people who have had to perform layoffs or RIFs will ever know the toll it takes on a leader/manager to look them in the eyes one after another after another after another and give them terrible and unforeseen news. For some reason there is a notion that managers could not care less about it and that it’s just part of our day. Are there really people out there like that? Maybe. I’ve got to believe I’m not in the minority and for most of us it is so depressing and we think about it for a long time to come. I will think about the new parents. The people who just bought a house. The person who just buried a parent. The person who just nailed an incredible project. The person who just got married and will get the call the day after their honeymoon… My phone call is going to cause them so much pain.

Thanks for listening. I don’t have anybody to talk to that understands or I don’t know how to talk about this topic with anyone…I’m unsure which.

Landed a managerial position and there are constant meetings and talking involved.

I get incredibly nervous and I know this is part of the position. Not much with my team members, more with higher ups face to face when they go a round the room that we need to explain a process.

I know what to say but in the moment my mind and heart race and my voice gets shaky. Any tips on how to navigate this?

Love my job but don’t t want to sound like a dumbass out of nerves of speaking publicly.

Thank you.

I am in FP&A and I am what you call a "working manager". We are assigned portfolios. In my portfolio I am seeing myself having to take on a bunch of projects in my portfolio. I also have one report I manage and that report handles her own portfolio. She is 100% utilized. I am probably 130-140% utilized if I take an average total hours I work every week over the required company hours every week. I try to delegate some work to my report too.

I am a senior manager. My report is a financial analyst. But the work I do on my portfolio of projects is the same work as what my report does, except I am also managing her and her portfolio. This also comes with the added bonus of having tons more meetings and calls, as well as having to work on side projects for process improvement etc. Not to mention the late night calls I have maybe once or twice a week. I accept this is what a Sr. Manager needs to do. But at what cost? Having to stay late until 7pm everyday? Seeing my work quality suffer because I can't keep up with everything? Fumbling during meetings because I don't have the time to be prepared for it because I had a bunch of grunt work to get done because of deadlines right before?

I have to do everything from the grunt work to actual managing. People expect me to keep up with small details and I am trying my best to write down notes and trying to keep track of small details on each project as they come up but things get lost, my memory gets really fuzzy, and I just can't remember things to save my life. I feel overburdened. I have to ask people things that I may have already gotten answers from before and they reply "I told you this a few weeks ago, don't you remember?" It's too much to keep up with, all the organized note taking, having a personal tracking file, it's still too much for me to handle. And I don't have the bandwidth to keep trying to track every detail which constantly seems to be the expectation for me..and I am expected to jump around to different projects almost every hour.

They were going to hire a Sr. Analyst but it was cut due to tightening budgets. So I am feeling rather helpless and slowly losing my mind, also starting to question my abilities and competence levels. I feel like I am doing everything wrong.

He seems to be working hard. He's not stupid for sure. So it seems he is motivated to perform and he isn't incompetent. But his performance is not exactly good. I can't pinpoint what is wrong with him. Here are some examples of his behavior:

He'd be on holiday for a day and my manager gets called up from a very important client saying that some issues he's handling has been unresolved for 3 weeks since they raised it and they are getting angry how long it's taking. My mamager isn't able to trace any effort he's been doing on this issue so she started investigation from scratch and wasted a lot of time, only to find out after his holiday that he did all the investigation already and just didn't get to a resolution, and he also didn't raise it to management to get help when it dragged on for so long.

when I question him how it's going on with a project, I genuinely am just trying to see if I can help, like escalation or just giving a second opinion, every time he is like everything is ok (when I know it's not, for example certain team did not get back to him when he needed support). It seems he's afraid others think he's incompetent so he tries to hide what is not going well. I've told him I want him to know I'm not here to judge him but here to help him, but I don't think I'm getting his trust and he's really trying to mask himself.

It's very hard to pinpoint what is up with him, but my gut says he's insecure and is very afraid of looking bad to me or anyone else so he doesn't escalate when things aren't going well. But that's my feeling and I don't know for sure.

Any thoughts? How do I deal with this?

First, I am not a manager but am trying to get there and at almost every job I've had I get the "you don't want that, job/position" from my managers.

My question is, is that statement a way of saying "you're to stupid for that job"

I'm a truck driver currently, have expressed desire to move out of the truck onto dispatch or management to my manager and that's the response I keep getting. It's been at almost every job and there's one theme, I consistently become "irreplaceable" (I know everyone is replaceable which is why it's in quotes, but I'm guessing everyone one of you managers has that employee that just gets the job done, brings few bitches to you and you can count on)

Here's the rant, if that phase isn't code for something then stop saying it. An employee has expressed desire to move in the future. You either can help them with that move and retain them or you can watch them go somewhere else. IMO thats the difference between a manages and someone that leads people.

Edit: first thank you to everyone that's commented, I tried responding to everyone but when I woke up this morning there is more than I can respond to before I start driving. There is a lot here for me and I appreciate it. Many of your comments made me think of things I need to work on personally and I will start immediately.

The grammar/spelling thing, I understand how it makes me look, I'm better in person and typing/texting has transitioned into "if it's understood as is I don't need to fix it". Also I haven't had to be concerned with technicality of it so I haven't had to worry about it, I understand how it can make me appear and will be working harder at it being correct. I do appreciate you looking past the errors and pointing them out rather than just letting me live in ignorance thinking people I communicate with would ignore it understanding the spirit.

I know management sucks, I know it's most likely not a raise or at least enough to compensate for the bs. My desire to get out of the truck has more to do with scheduling, flexibility, a want to help others grow, be able to use my brain and other things that I don't get currently. I am good at my job and really don't bring up issues unless it's serious or a repeated issue which happens maybe every 3-4 months. Even when they do come up I typically don't say anything until I've already fixed it. I tell my manager more to address the underlying issues that's causing it. I've gone weeks with out interacting more than a general greeting with management.

Again, thank you to everyone that's responded, you've all given me things to think about, apply, and work on and will start today. It means a lot to get actual feedback from internet strangers that I can actually apply.

I had a soar throat in the morning but once I got a to work after a couple minutes of my shift the fever hit me like a truck I never call off I understand my duty as a manager as much as I don’t like it I can’t be irresponsible but I just feel like garbage I let my GM know and that I’ll update her in the morning tomorrow but if I feel worse will it look bad on me for calling in sick?

I (F, 23) work for a finance department and about a month ago I was offered to take over as manager (my first managerial job) due to the current manager ‘T’ (M, 59) leaving the post for a new job. I’ve worked in the team for just over a year and was offered the job without having to interview. Prior to this I was the supervisor of the team with two people below me, one being employee ‘X’. The entire time I’ve been a supervisor I’ve been having issues with X taking direction from me despite me having the authority to ask for work to be done. Keep in mind I’m never rude and me and X even chat about work/ general home life from time to time so I don’t think this is a personal issue. X also happens to be from a foreign country where women are perhaps not always in charge. The impression I got (and I might be wrong) was that X had trouble taking direction from me due to me being young and female but had no problem taking direction from ‘T’.

Over the past year T and X have had around 3 or 4 informal, off the record chats regarding X’s performance. X has massively taken his foot off the pedal and has been bringing his personal problems with his partner into work. It got to the point where it was obvious that X wasn’t doing anything i.e. would always be on his phone/ wouldn’t take any initiative. Keep in mind that at this point we’re not tracking KPI’s.

T is more laid back than I am in nature and has kept these chats informal although has complained to me many times about X’s inability to work. We have also had two people leave over the past 3 months who have also complained that X isn’t pulling their weight.

Over the past month I have taken over as acting manager to get used to my duties while T works their notice period. Due to the backfill we’ve been interviewing for one other team member. Last week T and I interviewed two candidates whom we both liked equally. I mentioned the problems I’d been having with X to T and stated that in my ideal situation I would like to take both candidates on and replace X also. In this time, I have also implemented a dashboard to track the work the team members are doing. The report shows that X is not pulling his weight, sometimes closing 1 email a day (all our work is done through emails).

Everything happened very fast from then. T’s manager, who has been very supportive of my transition into the role and was the one who offered it to me, suggested we immediately place X on a PIP.

Prior to the PIP I got all the reports/ information together. T and I both sat down with X to let him know he was being placed on a PIP and the reasons why. We asked if there was anything we could do to help him through this time. I mentioned one instance of X not doing something I asked and me having to ask three times. X was very defensive, as expected, however this was mostly directed at me. Whenever T would speak, X would reply saying that he understood. However, when I spoke in the meeting X would aggressively challenge me on every point. I would have no issue if this attitude was directed at the both of us, but it seemed reserved only for me. The meeting ended with X stating that he had to go away and figure out if he ‘even wanted to be here’.

I informed T’s manager of the situation, and he recommended instant dismissal due to X only being here a short time (8 months), not managing his workload and his attitude towards me. I was quite happy with this as I think I would have found it near impossible to manage X once T has gone and, most importantly, I want competent people on my team.

I was not present when X was dismissed however, he has now contacted everyone (including ex colleagues) stating that his dismissal was unfair and that I was the reason he was dismissed.

People in the business have come to ask me what happened, and I fear that people have found what I did to be unfair. I’m worried that people may think I’m a bitch or too harsh/ the power’s gone to my head now that I’m in charge, especially as T didn’t fire him while he was in charge.

This honestly isn’t the case at all.

I’ve been feeling very guilty about firing X and I’m worried about how it’s making me look. I’m also worried about my reputation in the company/ my current team thinking I’m not easy going and approachable like T.

Was what I did right? And how do I manage the situation from here?

EDIT!!

Hi Everyone,

Thanks so much for taking the time to read my post and for all your comments, you’ve really reassured me that I did the right thing. Upon reflection, T really should have fired him a while ago.

I found out he called an ex-colleague and cried which, I’m not going to lie, has made me feel terrible but, had I kept him on, it would have been far too difficult for me. Also, he had displayed a pattern of negative behaviour for a few months, so his attitude wasn’t new.

He also called a new (2 weeks) member of my team to ‘warn’ him that I was tracking KPI’s. I’m assuming more was said about me being a hard ass in comparison to T. As a result, the new colleague has seemed very anxious and has been asking me for his score/ breakdown several times a day as well as if he can have access to the KPI report.

I took him aside and, without delving too many details, reassured him that the situation with X was different and that his scores were consistently low over a period of months and that this decision wasn’t just my own.

I’m very excited to take on this new role. I know I’m young and still have a lot to learn but I think I’ll make a good manager. I have no issues with the technical side of the role, but the people side is something I’m not familiar with so will take a little getting used to.

Again, thank you to everyone who commented and those who recommended tips, books, and courses. I’m so appreciative of the support and honoured to be a part of this little community.

All in all, I’m ready to put this situation to bed, should anyone else ask me anything, or should he get in contact, I will refer to the HR team.

Although I inevitably will have to fire someone again, I hope it’s not for a while!

Things you wished you had done differently, things you wish you knew then that you know now, advice for new managers?

You read that correctly. I had my performance review last week and one of the main things our Director told me to work on is being more of an a*shole (direct quote, lol). Basically I am too nice in my requests and don’t lay down the law when needed.

Being stern is against my (people pleasing) nature and I’m looking for resources to help me embrace my authority and be more firm.

Do you have any recommendations for books, podcasts, or videos that help managers be upfront and stern in communication? TIA

ETA: thanks for all of your comments. I ordered radical candor and am looking forward to reading it. Some additional context: I’m one of the youngest on the team, and worked in an assistant type role for my first 7 years with the department. I think part of my problem is the dynamic shift from working “under” the team and being there to help out, to then being promoted to their manager. I’ve been managing for 2 years now and I’m still growing into being in charge.

Also, my boss is definitely a jokester and he wasn’t 100% serious about being an asshole. The heart of his feedback was to be more clear and direct in my asks. He said something like “you’re so nice, if you aim to be an asshole, you’ll probably wind up in the sweet spot.” He said several times that no one wants to work for an asshole, but reiterated that it’s pretty unlikely I’ll ever get to that point based on how I am now.

Again thanks for your helpful input!

I live in a medium sized town of about 30,000 people. It doesn’t have a mall but plazas with free standing businesses like salons, fast food places, pet stores etc. as well as your usual chains like pizza places, grocery stores and dollar stores.

Anyway there is this one pizza chain I drive by daily. It has 2 parking spots in front of it, one is a wheelchair space. The rest of the parking spaces around it are shared by the rest of the plaza. The owner or manager parks in the single premium space every single day. All day. I get slices to go at this place quite regularly and at lunch hour the parking lot is usually busy with customers for other businesses. As I type this I’m parked a good 100 yards from the front entrance. Now I’m young and able bodied and don’t mind a good walk but, it’s kinda the principle.

Every job I’ve ever had the staff were made to park at the back of the lot or in some special staff lot outta the way so they don’t take up customer space.

Now this guy might be thinking his truck blends in with other customers and people aren’t realizing it’s always him taking position 1A but like I said… pretty small town, you notice things like this.

It’s not an egregious crime or anything but just in my opinion poor etiquette towards your customers especially the older folks or those with young kids who have to drag them through parking lots. It’s a take out place so rarely is there more than a couple cars actually shopping in that restaurant at a single time so that one space could be used by dozens of different customers over the course of the day.

IMO it just looks bad on the business in a small but noticeable way.

How about you? If you own a place like this do you take the best parking spot from your customers every day?

We had our EES survey results that showed our manager section did poorly. I posted about it. I didn’t know if it was my team or not. A comment suggested Manager Tools as a resource and I took their 1:1 template where they discuss spending 10 minutes talking about the future and their development.

I got some feedback from my team and took it to my boss which wound up with him saying that I’m too nice and will live a life of peace and joy, but will definitely never be a millionaire. I mentioned it to my mom and now I’m stressing because she said that wasn’t good and that he is very likely questioning my leadership skills.

Obviously this is frustrating because the only reason I even did this was to try to be a better manager for my team.

Maybe this just isn’t for me? Thoughts? How do I respond to my boss? I feel like I should follow up.

Edit: I love my job. I believe my boss has been absolutely phenomenal and great to me. He is a good person too, but definitely has a stronger personality and is more direct. I don’t understand what he says sometimes and this one comment really caught me off guard. After stewing on it, I don’t think he meant to hurt my feelings. My feelings were hurt because I am a sensitive type. In reading these comments I have found a lot of support and proposed next steps. I intend to clarify with him and use this as a development opportunity to go “nice” boss to “good” boss without losing my traits that I am proud to have.

How do you keep up with everything? I manage a team of 16 in Healthcare Revenue Cycle, specifically billing & follow-up. There are so many things I have to do in a day plus meetings, questions, etc. I find it so hard to get back on track.

Edit to add: I WFH!

I'm a manager of a customer service team in manufacturing. One of my employees who has been here 3 years has been steadily going downhill in terms of his happiness level. His work has never suffered because he's a hard worker, Army guy, it's just not in his nature to do less than 100%. But I've known he's been unhappy for some time.

My stance has always been that your mental health should come first, and if the job isn't right for you then it's not right for you and I am here to support your move to a better role, whether or not it's within the organization.

We've had the conversation once a year and each time he has expressed dissatisfaction but never once could say what kind of job he preferred or what he would rather be doing, in or outside of the organization. I've given him some opportunities to work on a task force with our product development team and he did fine on that, but again said it didn't really do anything for him.

He's in his thirties, no partner, no kids, but seems like a very satisfied person in general and everyone on the team adores him and thinks he is so sweet. His partner on his region would take a bullet for him and he for her. But he is just miserable in the job.

We had another conversation this week about the topic and I essentially let him know that I spoke to another manager that he had worked with and put in a good word but there are no positions right now. And again he doesn't think that position would make him happy. I've told him I would give him letters of reference and give him time to go interview. I gave him four questions that I had been given by a friend from a podcast on the types of things that you enjoy and are good at to try to zone in on areas of passion. He had no answers to that either.

I told my VP that I report to about the situation, and she basically said that it's not my responsibility to do anything other than open a requisition when I am able to. She's very big on coaching people but letting them fail or succeed on their own merits which I totally respect, although sometimes it's hard for me not to try to steer them a little harder than she would like me to.

The things making him miserable are things that are completely outside of my control, largely based on sales making asshole fuckhead decisions to serve the customer and fuck over every single department, causing this employee to get the brunt of customer frustration. I've made it clear that those things are not going to change. And sometimes part of customer service is just being the rule enforcers and getting screamed at in between all the times you get to make customers happy.

So what do I do in this case? I feel like I've done everything I possibly could to help him figure out what he'd like to do. I told him to give me notice so that I can fill the position. But we've had this conversation repeatedly and he never leaves. Do I just let him stay and be miserable? What happens if he just continues to stay? His work never suffers.

He tells you something is not his job, he doesn't care what his manager thinks, and pushes back on requests. Has every manager had that one employee that just shocked you with how difficult it was to communicate with that person, or get them to do their job?

Navigating soft skills challenges in the workplace is something I find myself doing often. Whether it's figuring out how to communicate that a team member won't be getting a promotion, or trying to inspire another employee, it's tough terrain.
I aspire to excel as a manager and lead my team effectively, but I often find myself without a reliable source for guidance. HR doesn't seem to get it, and I'd rather not let upper management in on the fact that I'm struggling.
Do any of you face similar challenges? How do you handle them?
Appreciate it!

Hi,

I manage a team of 7, boys and girls. I have the nagging suspicion that one of the women on my team has some kind of eating disorder (not anorexia or bulimia).

She has been with us for ~4 months. It’s not only me noticing this. At least 2 other people on my team have voiced similar concerns.

How do we get to this suspicion?

Well, she never eats anything, regardless of the time of day, be it at a team lunch, team dinner, or an afternoon Happy Hour. If she can’t avoid ordering something, she’ll order the smallest thing on the menu and not even touch it.

I can rule out financial concerns (company pays), lack of healthy or veg options, or any of the usual restrictions (lactose, glucose, …).

There are rumblings in the team because our team lunches are a pretty big deal in our social fabric, and it’s a buzzkill having someone sit there and not eat or drink a single bite.

Whenever I or someone else has encouraged her to order something, at least a glass of water, she’s „Nah, I‘m good“ or „I‘m not a lunch person“ or something of the sort.

I don’t want her to feel excluded, but our team lunches have become significantly less fun due to this behavior. And the team notices it, too. So I have to address it somehow.

On the other hand, this is a very sensitive and private topic. I‘m also not concerned for her health, she seems as healthy or unhealthy as the average 30-yr old.

I wouldn’t even think about going there if it wasn’t for the effect on the rest of the team.

Any ideas?

Posted this in another sub, but maybe here is more appropriate.

One of my team members and I are responsible for communications. We share the login info for various accounts. I just updated all the passwords because the old ones were terrible.

I remained logged in on our gmail account on my browser. I ended up on the gmail photos page and was greeted with a thumbnail of my coworker. And they did not appear to have any clothes on. I did not click on it because don't need this crap in my life.

My guess is that they ended up logged in on their phone to our work account and saved the pic to the work gmail photos instead on their personal gmail photos account (I don't personally use gmail so maybe this isn't how it happened, I don't know, just a guess).

I'm not sure if I should confront them. I mean it's awkward for them. But it's a problem from a work perspective and I'm not sure if they should be written up (I'm the manager, so I can't really escalate this a lot further, I think I need to deal with it).

I expected younger people to be more tech savvy. Like how do you make this mistake. I don't think it's a 'person bad with technology' mistake. This is a 'poor judgement and attention to detail' mistake.

Not a manager anymore as I left my industry for another for better hours. When I was though,I've done dozens and had some great some bad.

The worst though... had a guy nail the interview. Knew the industry well and seemed nice. Told him I'd let him know by the end of the day

He leaves and goes to get into his truck but one of our guys coming back from lunch supposedly cut him off as he was backing out. Checked the cameras later,wasn't even close.

Gets out yelling at him,trying to fight. Eventually cops came as he wouldn't leave and banged on the guy's truck

What's your worst?

Originally posted in Antiwork and someone suggested I post it here.

I work as a 2nd team lead over a department. My supervisor is on site, but stays in another department and doesn't fully understand the work flow where I am. The team has 4 tasks to work on and they are given a priority. We are to complete the priority 1 task then move onto priority 2, 3 and 4. However no one on the team likes to do the priority 2, 3 or 4 tasks. If we have a lot of priority 1 work their productivity is very high and can process 900 units in 8 hours. However if we only have 400 units of priority 1 work to process it still takes 8 hours. They intentionally slow down so they won't have to do work they don't like. It's driving me crazy. Every time I ask someone to work on priority 2 or 3 work even when priority 1 isn't done, they run straight to the supervisor telling them that I am taking them away from completing the priority 1 tasks. The supervisor then yells at me for not prioritizing task 1.

I had 3 experienced people that were highly productive but got upset that they were doing more than the newer less experienced team members and pretty much are my least productive people now. Other team members have seen that they slowed down and.slowed down even more.

I am in need of how to handle the team and my supervisor.

UPDATE

Our department is scheduled for 10 hour shifts because we are getting a lot of orders.

I started off the shift telling everyone that we are on overtime schedule because of the priority 2 and 4 tasks and that we needed to work them into our shift as much as possible. I got a full buy in from the team.

Since I have 3 workstations working with people in pairs, I pulled the extra person over to work on the 500 priority 4 orders and had no complaints from anyone. They did that for 4 hours and then I sent them back to finish up the priority 1 orders.

6 hours into the 10 hour shift I had 3 workstations doing priority 2 orders. Around this same time I had my mid shift check-in with my supervisor. First thing they said to me was, "Why did you have people working on Priority 4 orders?" I defended myself stating that I still have all 5 workstations doing the priority 1 orders and since 2 people are not required, I took the extra hands to work Priority 4. They backed down.

An hour later they sends me a message saying that the manager wants the entire department working the priority 4 orders the rest of the night.

I just LOL'd.

Hey fellow managers of reddit,

One of my employees started managing my team and I don't fully know if it's a good or bad thing.

I'm the lead of an IT department which is split into two teams, each with around 15 people.One team of 15 people gets managed by me and the other has its own team lead who is responsible for the other 15-ish people. That team lead directly reports back to me.

Now, the past 6 months I have been stuck in projects that upper management/the CEOs directly assigned to me and some other hand selected people within the company. Due to its importance all members of the project have to keep its contents a secret. My department/direct team knows I am stuck in the project, which in turn lead to me not paying as much attention to them as I should.

Due to it being the end of the year we hold mandatory one-on-one meetings with all our employees which, as it turns out, all report back to me saying "Everything is going perfectly.".

Honestly, I was pretty surprised as I somewhat hoped I could use them screaming for help as reason to get a bit of a break from the project, however, one of my junior employees started managing the 15 people without checking back in with me. She has been with us for around 4 years. The first two years she spent as a trainee as part of the team of my teamlead. After her training was over she did a job change (still within IT) and due to the topic of the position got moved into my team. She is someone who jumps into action without ever being asked, is able to see issues emerge before anyone has to ask for help and doesnt shy away from any form of conflict. Those at first sound great, but she can be pretty radical with certain changes and voices them in "non-professional ways" at times.

The issue is, she has no form of training when it comes to management and inserts herself into meetings with her collegues who apparently needed help with external contractors, other department leaders, etc.

No one ever told me about it and when I asked the other department leads if they didnt find it strange that she was just there they went "Sure, at first I did but she was very open about trying to find solutions and provided those shortly after so I just thought it was correct for her to be there. I didn't question it."

Apparently she also somehow got access to the files to our budgets from our sales department because, and I quote, "She asked nicely." So far she controlled our budget perfectly and kept internal projects going.

I will admit, I feel in some way threatened because it all seems like it comes to her easily and it just seems like she tries to take my job. I haven't talked to her yet, but I think she clearly overstepped some boundaries. At the same time I can't deny that the work she did was awesome. She apparently also solved some personal issues with some other collegues that felt pretty demotivated as I wasn't around to give them a proper direction to take.

What are your all thoughts on this? Right now we got no position for another team lead open and aren't allowed to create new ones due to covid restrictions still going on until around May of next year.

Edit: Grammar

I basically give them multiple chances to achieve the bare-minimum of work acquired for the job, but I find people take advantage of your kindness. I've been told that I'm too timid and merciful as a manager and that I should be writing employees up more for doing way less work. I want to be fair and just, I also don't want my employees to fear me. I just want a mutual understanding. What should I do?

I’m interviewing soon and would like to be prepared. it’s remote and the job would be more heavily focused on marketing vs PR and social media, which isn’t a concern for me since my career has always revolved around many aspects of marketing such as project management and campaign creation and optimization but the last three years don’t speak to that they focus more on content creation and strategy. Any tips on how I can still make an impression and speak to skills I haven’t used in the workforce in a while?

I started at a new company last month. The previous manager was friends with all the employees and let them do whatever they pleased. Coming shortly behind her anytime I try to enforce a company policy it’s met with “well Casey let us do it” or “we’ve always done it this way.” I have been retraining all my staff but as the title says they are very set in their ways. My supervisor has been extremely supportive however at this point we are both at a loss of new ideas.

Does anyone have any ideas to motivate employees?

Just last year, companies were scrambling to keep staff. Now, bosses say not enough people are leaving their jobs.

Turnover has fallen so significantly at some major employers that companies are now over budget on a number of teams, forcing executives to consider whether to cut additional workers as the year-end approaches or to postpone projects.

Hi, I'm specifically looking for feedback from other managers and people in HR.

I have not had to hire in 2 years, my group has been very stable. I posted a new job last week and I'm shocked at two things. One, the number of barely qualified resumes, and then a surprising number of people with masters applying for an entry level position.

But the thing that gets me is the number of people posting divisive politcal BS on their linkedin pages. I think of Linkedin as a place for a sanitized snapshot of your professional life, not a place for nasty political stuff. If I find someone has a link to an antisemetic group on their page, its an instant disqualifier for me. I have a very diverse team, there's absolutely no way I'm hiring someone like that.

Is it just me or have things changed recently? Do people not realize that employers look at this and use it to make hiring decisions?

I just removed Instagram off my phone to see how my quality of life is affected. Does anyone have any apps that I can put in its place? I would prefer ones for productivity, mindfulness, and/or professional development?

How do you handle running a group that is always pinned with faults and negatives?

I became a supervisor 2 years ago, and i can say i acquired a burning ship. Its gotten decently better overtime, but theres always something other departments look to blame on us because its the easier targets.

For example, the tech manager came into the office and showed me a report that said it looks as were not doing nothing because this file would change. I looked at other offices report and their files are the same.

Also, emails get blasted to top executives saying we screwed up, but the cause of the issue cant be determined. I do my own investigation, trying to eliminate my team as the problem.

Everyone in the organization knows i know what im doing. Or they pretend i dont because they would have to acknowledge im right. Ive been with the company for about 12 years and have repeatedily shown my knowledge in all aspects of the company. Theyve even whispered about it to others.

Im personally feeling like a target, like theyre trying to push me out. But i dont know. But im definitely carryimg the burden of being the stupidvisor.

So far, my managers got my back, but he is being awfully quiet about it, which is another problem in itseld. Im going to remain calm and take the blows for now, but if it gets out of hand like im expecting it to, i will look to leave.

I’m male, and my friend is male and now dating a woman I supervise. I have a great working relationship with her, though I’m perhaps a little concerned about boundaries. My friend asked to bring her over when we were hanging out and I wasn’t totally sure. It’s not that things are actually awkward, just looking for advice on how to maturely handle everything.

One of my direct reports is responsible for clearing down a purchase invoice queue daily. The task isn’t complex, but it needs to be kept on top of.

Each day, invoices come in automatically and the employee should clear the queue to zero. Rinse and repeat daily. Now the problem is the employee doesn’t do it daily and the invoices stack up. I feel the need to then keep checking the queue and reminding the employee to complete the task.

There are only 15 invoices a day max and each should take no longer than 2 mins. We talked about the process and I suggested they should tackle it “little and often” rather than let it build up and become unmanageable. The employee is capable and they understand what they need to do, but they never quite deliver on time and there is little urgency without me stepping.

How can I make them more accountable and change their behaviour?

Anyone care to share some successful tips for how to handle all the emotional baggage that comes with being a manager? Maybe I just ended up with a bad bunch but my staff of 20 employees can be a HUGE mental load. I have one worker who is a pathological liar and has been reported multiple times for her lies, one worker who is a complete narcissist, a worker who despite being with the agency for longer than I have been alive acts like she can't make a single decision on her own (which makes zero sense because she actually trained me and I KNOW she knows what she is doing), and another who is using her "anxiety" as an excuse to basically not do her job. Out of the three offices that I manage, two of them are constant drama. There is always something wrong. I've been with this agency for 6 years and the manager over this group for just over a year and they have me job searching for the first time in years with the constant negativity and drama...

I have an employee that I could use some help with setting boundaries and expectations. I work in Healthcare, and we have a process where I'm the bottleneck in acquiring hard copy POs for a lot of our vendors when it comes to calling in service and/or parts. I am typically quick. I can usually get my team what they need in the same business day or the first half of the next if it is urgent. My issue is with one of my employees who is extremely impatient and lacks respect for boundaries. He will repeatedly ask about the same issue multiple times in a day, even going as far as to ask me if I've checked my email. I don't typically mind my team being concerned with getting their work done, but it's gotten to the point where I've found myself getting a bit rude to him because it's grating. I find myself wanting to say something like, "Of course I check my email, and of course I'm doing my job. You're just being extremely impatient and choosing not to work on other things." I've tried gently talking with him about this in earlier months, explaining the process and why there's a delay, explaining the expected timeline, etc. None of it helped, however.

I posted this on another retail (mostly employee based) sub when it happened and got roasted, but I'm looking for a second opinion.

I am the Store Manager of a specialty retail store. One of my assistants scheduled an interview to fill a vacant PT spot on their team.

The night before the interview, the area was hit with violent storms including tornado touchdowns, and as a result, several members of my team didn't make it into work, including both of my assistants. I was already scheduled off, however my supervisors stepped up, covered the store and as a result, I was not needed.

Unfortunately, my assistant did not remember to have someone cancel the interview. The candidate showed up and no one was available to interview him. My supervisor explained the situation, apologed and rescheduled.

The candidate did not show up for his rescheduled interview and a couple of days later, his father calls me, clamming that I run an unorganized operation and it's unacceptable that no one was available to interview his son when he arrived as scheduled. I explain the situation to his father and he says that is not excuse even during a natural disaster.

Personally, I think I dodged a bullet but what do you think?

TLDR: My assistant scheduled an interview but was unavailable to conduct said interview due to natural disaster. Candidate's father berated me for running a disorganized business.

This morning in a management meeting, a colleague said something that didn’t sit right with me as an executive manager.

Colleague said “I don’t hire anyone who is overqualified because you’re wasting your time on someone who will always be looking for something better,” and then proceeded to say “like I never leave my desk, so I don’t understand how someone can get a WFH job and think that they can do whatever they want.”

Here are my thoughts on this:

The market is horrendous. PMs, executives, and senior managers are desperate for roles after layoffs. I think this is a terrible outlook on potential candidates. I am overqualified for my role but desperately needed a job and was hired, but it does not mean I don’t take it seriously.

I feel that people should always look where the grass is greener. Frankly, I’d be more concerned with anyone who doesn’t have ambition or drive. Not to say I love flaky, unreliable, people, but I don’t see anything wrong with wanting the best for yourself.

This idea that because you’re WFH, you should be a slave to your desk is ridiculous to me. In office, I had way more social interaction and honestly did less work than I do at home. It has been proven that most people thrive in a wfh environment because of the lack of distractions. People are human and deserve to be treated as such.

It was just disheartening to hear and I was disappointed in the sentiments.

Hi, sorry I am sorta new to being a manager but I want to learn. This is just a simple fast food restaurant.

Two of my best employees let me know that another employee had been yelling/screaming at them two for quite some time now. He also has been very lazy and underperforming. So I fired him. After I did, it occurred to me that he is friends with a few other coworkers. I am just worried they will quit in retaliation/spite. Keep in mind, these are all kids. All aged between 18-23

I think I would be better off in the long run if that were to happen, because I would think there is some sort of "us vs other coworkers" dynamics going on if employees would quit if their coworker friend got fired. And if that was the case, that would mean there was a toxic work environment.

I always grant requested time off. If you want a day or a few days off, cool. Just let me know in advance. I don't make a big fuss about being a few minutes late. Recently an employee texted me he was having a family emergency, and I texted back that I was sorry to hear and that I got the shift covered. I would say I do not micro manage. The coworkers I am worried about quitting occasionally bring me a drink from 7/11, and I occasionally do the same. We talk sports, video games etc, so I am trying to say we seem to all have a good relationship. I understand we are not friends, but we are all amicable.

So what I am trying to say, I try to be a good and fair manager. I don't think employees would quit out of retaliation/spite, but I am just stressed out at the thought of it.

Sorry if this post doesn't belong here. It seems this subreddit is more oriented for professional/skilled/office/trade sort jobs, not simple fast food jobs. I am also making this post as a way to vent a bit

Thanks

Wanted to ask everyone to share an experience they’ve had on the job where you thought to yourself- ‘Damn I have a good boss’…

Hi! I hired about…6 months ago a wonderful Trans lady, who I’ll call Sue. She has been a godsend and I cannot say enough wonderful things about her. However, I have been fighting with our HR about her deadname, Bob.

Every piece of information that has her name on it has Bob on it versus Sue until I pick a fight. Email, phone directory, website, her company timesheet login, you name it. It’s getting ridiculous.

HR says that because Sue has not updated her SSN that their hands are tied. Are they? Is there material that has to have the name on her SSN card by law versus her name?

It’s very confusing for me as they had no issue with using my preferred shortened name versus the longer more complicated full name.

Lost an amazon warehouse job that paid 20.75 an hour due to a freak accident right before the holiday. I had 3, back to back $1500 work weeks due to overtime that i missed out on because of my termination. First thing i did was apply on indeed to anything i believe i could reasonably do. nobody got back to me yet since i started the other day. Started the same application spiral today, applied for a restaurant position thinking it was just a team member position, it wasn't until they got back to me a few mins ago that i realized i applied for assistant manager and have an interview on Wednesday the 6th!!! I have a little fast food experience but thats it, im desperate for a job what do i do, do i chance it and try to wing it or just find something else, if i should go with it what are some helpful tips?

Would you consider this offense worthy of termination

What would you do in this situation? Typically we have new employees submit a short bio and a headshot that we use to list team members on our website and introduce them to the company through our internal Slack & newsletter. Not everyone has a professional headshot, so we frequently have employees do the best they can with selfies, or having a friend snap a pic, but this is a first:

I have a new employee starting soon that submitted a photo that I suspect has been altered through AI - it resembles the person I met in the interview, but about 10 years younger. The smile is a little too wide to be 100% real, the ears are unrealistically warped, and the face looks airbrushed.

I’d like to ask them for a more authentic picture, but want to tread lightly since they may have insecurities that led them to creating the highly filtered version of themselves. I’m worried that they may be setting themselves up for a bad first impression with team members recognizing that the picture does not come across as realistic. Is there something better than saying your photo looks mildly terrifying & is too uncanny valley to be real? Can you submit another?

EDIT/Update : Thanks for the feedback, everyone! The real problem is that the headshot is going to be put on the public website, and it clearly doesn’t match the more natural style of other headshots posted there. The clear answer is that if a consistent style is important, the marketing team needs to hire a photographer to make that happen.

I’m not going to worry about it further. There is an opportunity coming up for employees to get a professional headshot & the new employee is going to be offered the opportunity just like everyone else.

I've been in management at my company for several years now. I've always had a small cracker box of an office overlooking the plant I manage. I'm finally getting a proper office in the admin wing.

I'd like to have an office plant of some type, but I have no clue what would be suitable. What sort of plants do well in an office? I was thinking like a small cactus garden (I like those), maybe? Six small pots on a 2 tier stand I build at home is what I want. The plants will need to be low maintenance, suitable for a 4" to 6" pot, not too bushy, and thrive under the LED sun. The office is ground level and has 1 window facing east.

I know this isn't the typical question here, but I spend 50 to 70 hours a week at work, and I'd like a plant now that I'll have room for more than my desk and trusty file cabinets.

I was hired at a company 5 months ago and was hired above the previous head of the department who was at a Director level. This person was the head of the department only because the previous head of department was let go -- i.e. it wasn't a promotion due to qualification.

This person was previously on a monthly executive meeting with department heads and the CEO and leadership. Since I joined, the CEO asked me to attend in this person's place -- being the new department head.

Recently, this employee asked if they could attend this meeting again. To which I said it's a small meeting and we're really keeping it to those who are presenting or participating (these are topics this person isn't involved with). They continued to pursue it and asked repeatedly to ask the CEO if they could attend. The reasoning was they wanted to be in the loop on what other teams were doing. I said I could improve my reporting out of status. The requests pressed on, and they said they wouldn't even have to participate just be a fly on the wall -- to which I said we're moving away from "fly on the wall" meetings, which is true.

How can I handle this in a tactful way? In previous roles I couldn't imagine asking my boss "hey can I attend that CEO meeting?" or "hey I'd like to attend the board meeting next month...".

Edit: the employee went to the ceo after the ceo made clear to me it was just department heads going forward. CEO calls me and says just invite them. Now I’m the asshole.

I manage a team of administrators for a frontline service. Generally, morale in my team is very high. I have good relationships with them and they do a fantastic job. It’s a very successful working relationship and we have reached a point where my team would rather work from the office than from home. When I moved into the role I actually increased the amount of working from home days to once per week rather than once per month. Most of the team take advantage of this.

I have a member of staff who suffered an unexpected bereavement of a close family member 6 months ago. She was given bereavement leave as per our leave policy of 5 days, but felt she could not return to work, so had the next month off sick, signed off by a doctor. During this time I kept in touch with her once per week and referred her to our employee support service.

Once her sick leave expired I met with her and we agreed that she would temporarily be allowed to work fully remotely, with a planned phased return to the office over a period of 2 months. On her first day back in the office, a senior manager pulled me aside and said that my team member did not look well, and advised me to send her home. Feeling trapped, I complied and she happily went home.

We continued regular check-ins and she expressed that she did not want to return to the office. I explained that we provide support to a frontline service, working from home is not a long-term option, and that we will need to facilitate a return. I asked her if she would agree to an occupational health referral, which she did. She had this appointment, and the advice given was that she would benefit from working remotely if business needs allowed it. I spoke to the head of my department and they said that business needs do not allow it, she has been at home long enough, get her in.

I planned out another phased return with my team member, with 25% increments, so 1 day 1 week, 2 the next, until the full 4.

When she was due to be in for 2 days per week, I was on leave. I asked her to continue to attend the office for 2 days whilst I was off, to let me know her 3 for the week after, and to liaise with the covering manager for any issues. I return from leave and the covering manager reports she has not been in. I speak to my team member and she says that she will try to get in but has counselling.

I had a conversation with HR and they recommended further support services. Today I spoke to my member if staff and our relationship has completely broken down. She said all the services are a waste of time, nobody gets what she is going through. I called HR again, and they basically said I have been nice enough, tried to support her, and she is taking me for a ride, so get her in. So I have now told her that she has to be back in work. She said that she would try and was close to storming out of the room, shouting at me abd saying I don’t understand.

Could I have done anything differently? I feel that maybe I could have been firmer, and made her stick to the phased return, but she has not complied with it and senior management disrupted it by essentially forcing me to send her home. HR were at a loss with it.

EDIT: Thank you for all of the responses. It is interesting to see that some think I have been too weak as a manager here and that others think I have been too harsh. I appreciate all of the replies here, maybe apart from a couple of vindictive ones.

Ultimately I think there is a middle ground. My team are sympathetic towards her and do not yet resent this person for working from home. I believe that they appreciate having a manager who would allow them that flexibility should the worst happen and something similar happen to them.

The plan going forth will be that my worker returns to the office. If she does not engage with this then disciplinary procedures will follow.

I have some learning points, to be firmer in my resolve, and to trust that my decisions are correct. Should senior management become involved in this again I will respectfully suggest that they allow me to follow my plan as I have acted in tandem with HR guidance.

Thanks all.

This might just be venting, but I genuinely feel stuck and see this sub as a pool of mentors.

I've been a mid-level manager for over 2 years at an excellent company. I'm doing well, but don't feel like I'm thriving, particularly when it comes to associate development. Initially I thought that this role would be a good way to overcome my interpersonal anxiety (which was a big personal and professional goal), and while it helped tremendously, I find that I just don't like it. It feels like so much of it boils down to telling people to do their job (stop circumventing procedure, call your customers, show up on time), or to be decent humans (don't trash talk other departments, play nice with your colleague). I just find it frustrating and baffling that I should even have to explain this to others.

I guess I took for granted that everyone is just as motivated as me. I try so hard to inspire, lead with empathy, and elevate my team's skills, but it is draining me. I like having responsibility and growth opportunities, but I'm feeling stuck and having trouble seeing the bigger picture. Does it get better in higher management? What else is there that doesn't require managing others but has growth potential?

I work for a non-profit and when I started as leader of one of the program areas, the program had essentially collapsed after a leadership change and there was only one employee, a new hire who started 3 months prior to my hiring, who acts as .5 admin to my team and .5 to the "front desk." The new hire is not trained in the program area and is there to provide clerical support (we deal with youth, so there is confidentiality/legal/insurance paperwork to handle); her job is to stay at the front of the office as an overall administrative assistant (to the non-profit, not my program) and when not occupied with that, she's meant to do clerical work for my team. I pay half her salary from my team budget.

From the very first day, this person has been extremely challenging to work with. As there had been no one on the team, there was no one to set boundaries with her, so she thought of herself as the team lead. Once I started, she was immediately upset when I "took work away" from her (her words); I recognize that and said I did indeed take work, as this is a team and we need to share responsibilities. She also struggles to multitask so a lot of things needed to be done. She asked me to give her task lists each week and I've done that, but she always finds a way to make a simple task (literally print signs was one task) a bigger problem. I answer her questions quickly and with logic (for example, she changed the font on the printed signs that I asked for, so I asked her to reprint as we have to be ADA compliant, and I explained compliance, which has already been taught to her several times).

This is where I know I fuck up: I am very direct and will answer her questions without compliments, etc; I am not going to thank her for making a task more complicated than it needs to be. I will just ask for what I need, say thanks when it's done, and that's her job/my job. She often pouts or sulks when I ask her not to do something--I ALWAYS make sure to explain that it's outside the scope of work and that it's not a bad idea, just not something we can pursue, but she seems to take it personally.

I've been spending my time trying to figure out what worked for the program, what didn't, and what happened to cause the collapse--higher level strategy. In the meantime, I've struggled to manage the employee as I'm NOT her direct supervisor (that's the office admin supervisor) and when I tell her something, she goes to other employees to ask to "double check" that I'm right. For context, I have experience and knowledge and a masters degree in this programming area. She will waste 2-3 other people's time only to get the same/similar answers.

I have also overheard her THREE TIMES gossiping about me, mainly that she thinks I don't know anything and that I make choices too quickly. The people she's gossiping/complaining to are all just sounding boards, not really responding, which at least feels better.

I've been speaking with my director about how to manage this person. I've been begging for help and professional development. Frankly, managing her takes up far more time than I find worth it and I've gotten to the point where I would like her removed from clerical work for my team. I have a new hire starting soon and I need to address the behavior so it doesn't create a bad team dynamic.

Director recommended "norming" to create better boundaries within each role, so I tried that, but it turned into a major mess. The employee said she didn't feel heard--I apologized to her, genuinely as I know my sense of urgency can make some people feel steamrolled sometimes--but I also told her that I feel like I can't trust her due to the gossip and the distrust she has had a part in creating. I asked that we apologize to each other, to which she refused, so I had to get the director to come in to mediate as I could not continue the meeting; I told the director that I can't move forward until we acknowledge the harmful behavior we've BOTH contributed to. The director, a trained mediator, spent 20 minutes laying groundwork and I apologized, recognized the behavior that harmed her, promised forbearance, and assured that I'm genuinely trying to work on things...and she refused to acknowledge that she contributed negatively at all. The director ended the meeting because we weren't going to get anywhere, and now we have to go to mediation with HR tomorrow morning to create a working agreement.

I love the program that I'm trying to rebuild. I love the position I'm in. I get along with all the other teams at this non-profit, I collaborate well, I know I'm doing a good job. But I truly cannot manage this person. I cannot work with passive aggressive behavior that only becomes more aggressive when I ask for it to stop. I'm terrified that I'm going to be let go—the director has outright told me that it reflects poorly on me that I can't manage one .5 person—because one person, who I didn't even get to choose for my team, is refusing to work within boundaries I've tried to set. What am I supposed to do here? How do I go into HR mediation tomorrow knowing that I may be on the chopping block due to my failure to manage this employee? Please help.

I am currently a manager in the hospitality industry. I am being promoted to a director role soon and will have to hire for my soon to be vacant role. No one on my current staff is qualified to fill the role so I will have to find an outside candidate that will now report to me. Any suggestions or advice from anyone that has been in this position? Things I’m worried about are a current employee applying and becoming disgruntled they don’t get promoted, the new manager disrupting the great chemistry the team has now, and me having to do two jobs during this hiring phase.

I heard from a member of the leadership team that one of my subordinates has been telling at least one other person they are unhappy with their assignment and how things have been going - but they did not give full details and did not want to share their source.

In my weekly meetings with this person they have been affirming they are happy and haven’t been indicating they weren’t.

I’ve called a meeting with them to check in and am looking for advice on how to address the situation. If they won’t tell me they are unhappy, should I reveal that I’ve been hearing otherwise? How do I work with incomplete details from the person that came to me? Thanks in advance

I am setting up a new office and three new employees will belong to a union. The agency offered them a starting salary that COULD be a good 20% higher if they advocate for themselves before signing on. HR is not telling them this. Should I?

UPDATE I told them how to get the contract-which HR did not share with them- and told them to consider making the request. I think it’s LOW to not share this information with folks. I’ll probably get fired as management is NOT protected by Union😖

This happened to me 10 years ago as an analyst where I had a co-worker who was an analyst and didnt know SQL. Then he couldnt do vlookups. So, I was literally asked to all his vlookups for him. leaving him with no manual work to do

Its happened on my team more recently where I had a "problem employee" making 180k a year a senior software engineer and she was doing 0 fucking work. So, my boss was sending all her work to this outsourced contract employee on my team that we pay 7k A YEAR.

And to me , its pretty unethical to pay some poor smuch 7k a year and give them the responsibilities of a sr software engineer making nearly 30xs that. Guy making 7k a year deserves to have a long training and onboarding period that an entry level employee gets and easier task matching his salary.

But, I see this time and time again. Where there is someone on a team doing practically nothing and the manager just lets the rest of the team pick up the slack. like why do some managers think thats an ok thing to do?

I usually buy them candy or once I bought them company-branded coffee cups. Any good ideas? I might skip entirely this year.

Do you think the following is an ethical business practice? And what would you do as a manager?

An employee gave their 2 week notice and the decision was made to terminate their employment immediately, instead of letting them finish their scheduled shifts.

The employee had missed 3 days in 8 months of employment, done all of their work as expected, plus some. Accurate and very good with customers. There were no disciplinary actions taken during employment.

However, the employee failed to respond to group text messages on correcting work. They also only responded with short and to the point answers. They were unable to make mandatory meetings. Also noting that the mandatory meetings were scheduled with 24 hours notice or less.

The employee lost a total of 80 hours of scheduled employment.

One of the employees I manage has gotten a performance bonus nearly every month for over a year now. The bonus is only loosely tied to his performance as there are other team members whose efforts overlap with his duties and it is impossible to pinpoint exactly which results come from which employee. Over time his mindset has eroded from "I should work extra hard to earn this bonus" to "I'm entitled to this bonus for just doing my job".

Recently I have changed the conditions for the bonus to make it more fair and more directly dependant on his work ethic. Unsurprisingly he failed to get the bonus for his last pay period and now he is saying I'm not being fair and that he deserved that bonus, and complaining that I took it away from him.

What can I do?

My boss is the owner of the company and she always criticizes everyone's tone and emails. She always assumes how we talk or email her is how we interact with clients and doesn't get that there's client-facing communication and internal communication.

Funny enough, she's very curt and pushy in her emails to us. I wanted to mention it but I know it won't go over well. So, I've just ignored it but I wonder if you all think there's a good way to point it out. It seems very hypocritical of her but I doubt she'll be receptive to any criticism.

I’m a manager for a restaurant and my lead brought up a text message to me from our same team how he was apparently drunk and texted her very inappropriate things, we’re talking “I had a dream about you last night..” you know where this is going.

In short, it happened. She feels uncomfortable. I talked with my district manager and I’m forming up a statement and other details for HR for this employee. Sexual harassment is what it’ll be under I believe, I haven’t dealt with this before and I just don’t understand.

The saying “don’t sh*t where you eat” just don’t do it. It’s not worth it.

Also, while talking with my district manager he mentioned something disturbing that this company “sexual harassment” happens way more common that I think.

Welp, time to settle this conflict and start looking into another company.

Edit: thank you for the comments, didn’t know this would get many comments. To answer your question why would I look for another job: I didn’t realize this was very very common. My area manager also said this happens a lot in this company.. not surprised since the face of this company is a total creep himself. It’s kind of new realization and first time happening to me in my team. Learning to settle it and handle it to be ready for future events is the right choice rather than just “quitting” because it will happen in any company

This is a simple exercise, just answer with a yes or no.

Obligatory edit:

Do you, as an individual employee, trust HR? Yes or no?

Context: I am not a super experience manager, about 2.5 years of experience so I haven’t “seen it all” and this is the first time I am experiencing a competition for headcount.

I have a boss and this boss manages a team of 4 managers. One of this managers is me and another manager is this person I’ll call P.

I started at this company 2 months ago and P. started 4 months ago, both of us are new.

I’ve done my onboarding, check the planning and priorities for the different teams I manage, track the workload of each of my reports, talk to them about what they are doing and the would like to keep doing…etc

So after I did all this “audit” I found out that 4 out of 6 of my direct reports are assigned or working on tasks that belong to the area of this other manager call P. These 4 persons are spending more than 60% of their time working on P’s assignments.

This leaves me with no headcount to plan and execute on my area’s objectives. I talked with P. and brought this issue, his rational is that his areas’ tasks have higher prio and we are understaffed.

We are understaffed, true, and we are hiring, but specially for my area (I oversee three verticals and P. oversees 1)

The prio issue is on a grey area. One of his tasks are the number 1 prio but number 2,3,4,5 prio belong to my teams.

I don’t know if I should scale this to our boss. He is very busy. I also haven’t had time to set up my goals with my boss yet. So it’s hard to justify any decision I might need to take

How should I handle this. In the other company I’ve worked as a manager your headcount was “sacred” so I am in shock of this new culture

I have an employee who I’ve put on PIP for poor performance — didn’t get work done on time, constantly made errors and turned in sloppy work, and in general very absent from his responsibilities (constantly required reminders for his tasks to get done- if he isn’t told or reminded to do something, even if he has been told in past or is aware something should be done, he will not take action or ownership). He has nearly 10 years of total relevant work experience, the role expectations are for someone with 5+ years, yet he is struggling to meet minimum expectations.

Before putting him on PIP, I gave him months of feedback, coaching, and spent a lot of my time and effort into helping him improve. I truly tried to support him in turning things around, because otherwise he’s very personable and always displayed respectful, good behavior. He gets along well with his teammates and helps them out when he can, had a good and receptive attitude even when he was taking negative feedback, and can actually produce good work on rare occasion. To be honest, I think this was why it took me so long to acknowledge the reality that despite the good qualities, he was simply not cutting it at his job and I was getting burnt out as a result.

I can tell he is trying earnestly to pass the PIP and has made some improvements, but ultimately he’s still not meeting the mark to perform his job responsibilities as required at a consistently acceptable level. It’s my first time putting someone through a PIP, and I’m having a hard time staying strong to the objective decision that I need to replace him with someone else in his role.

What also makes it difficult is that I’m the only one, as his direct manager, who is seeing and experiencing the pervasiveness of the issue. Although my boss understands the situation and stands by whatever decision I make, he likes the employee in general as a person (as do I), and we’ve had some discussions that have made me second-guess my stance. He asked, for example, whether we might be setting standards that were too high.

Just wanted to get some advice and thoughts… I appreciate it.

I think we have all had this happen at least once. Someone was either let go for legitimate reasons or they just stopped coming in. One day they come back and say “can I have my job back?” How do you react? Obviously it depends on the situation they left on. But who has said no? Do you ever regret it? Who here has said yes? Did it work out?

Edit: thanks everyone for the different pieces of advice its much appreciated. I have got the ball rolling with a 1:1 booked with her tomorrow to get an understanding of whether she's aware of the issue and will go from there to see whether or not she can improve her communication/comprehension skills.

Hey there, I'm quite new to being a team leader and my boss has been less than helpful with this so hoping someone could give me an idea of how to manage it.. I have a team member that I did not hire but was forced into my team due to a restructure.

She is the kindest woman and I can tell she wants to do well, but her basic reading, writing and comprehension skills are just not up to par.

She frequently disrupts other team members by banking up emails that she doesn't understand (email communication accounts for about 60% of her role as she looks after incoming mail from shared inboxes) and then wants them to explain the emails to her. These emails are not specific to a process or something she isn't across, she just doesn't understand English well. I've had 3 team members come and complain to me saying they're not here to teach her how to read and its slowing them down. They dread getting a call from her and dread receiving a message to the point where they're starting to ignore her.

We also have a roster for running team meetings, and in one of them she is required to read out a customer story from a pre-written huddle board. Each time she does it, she needs help from others to say words (not difficult words, ones that come to mind from the last one are "accept," "proactive" and "approach" ).

Obviously this is a bit of a sensitive topic to address, so I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas for how to address this with her/ manage it?

What would you think of an employee who has never been promoted in his 25 year career? He basically has a complete contempt for anyone in "management". Here's the rub- he's competent, accredited and a licenced engineer earning over $200K. As far as I can tell, he hangs around for a couple of years, finishes off his projects and just moves on.

Looking for some recommendations.

Long story short: the manager I recently replaced was at the center of an HR shitstorm that caused the Director (my boss) months of heartburn. During the investigation process, the employee who was the right-hand of the previous manager, openly sided with the previous manager against the Director.

*I was working for a different company at the time of these events.

It’s a few months later and now I’m running the team. This employee is easily one of the most knowledgeable and hardest working on my team. They are also overdue for promotion. However, my boss continues to ask for me to pull back their responsibilities, and has even said that he “hopes this employee gets the message and quits”. This is after I’ve explained my assessment of the employee’s performance and work ethic.

Other than this issue, I really like my boss and this position. This employee is not a hill I’m willing to die on, but it’s becoming uncomfortable to have to continuously make excuses for why responsibilities are getting rolled back.

I’m brand new to management, so I’d appreciate any advice experienced managers can provide to help me navigate this situation.

*Edit: for additional context on the “HR shitstorm”.

The previous manager (female with 2 years at the company) was upset that her senior subordinate (male with 28 years at the company) made more money than her. She continuously harassed this senior subordinate and encouraged the other subordinates to do the same. Her right-hand employee was directly involved in this harassment.

When the Director found out about this, he pulled the senior member off the team (putting him on a special project) and disciplined the former manager. The manager got HR involved claiming the discipline was “gender discrimination”.

Since I’ve been here, the issues have cooled off. I’ve made it explicitly clear I have a zero tolerance policy for harassment and my team members have been gradually working more with the previous senior employee.

I work in an office, our team provides phone support. One of our more recent hires came to us with relevant experience in the field, came well recommended by industry colleagues we trust. She is doing well, has a firm grip on the basics and is progressing well on the stuff that is particular to our organization.

The issue I have is that twice now after reviewing tasks completed, getting feedback and issuing a new set of tasks, when I ask if she's got it or if she understand the assignment, the response has been "Yes, Daddy." No eye contact, no hint if she's being facetious, serious, flirty, playful, making fun of me or anything. Straight face, nothing in her tone to indicate...anything. We have no biological connection. It may be noted that she is mid 20's, I am mid 50's.

Nothing in our interactions could be considered flirtatious, no conversation or humor that could be remotely sexy. We are never alone in the same room, brief interactions occur with doors and windows open. Neither of the times she's given this response was anyone within earshot. She has otherwise been completely professional with me, no indication of issues with any other staff. Since it's happened twice, I'm thinking it's intentional, perhaps to gauge a response from me.

Here's what I'm thinking; Next time it happens (if it happens), stop the conversation, gently but firmly let her know that that is a less than professional or appropriate response. She may refer to me by my first name, Mr. last name, Sir if the occasion seems formal, or "Boss" as some of my staff colloquially refer to me.

Any thoughts, ideas, or alternates course of action suggestions?

This is for married managers. I am currently struggling to deal with the mental load of managing a team of 15 people. They are a very diverse group and every one of them has an annoying quirk, they are needy, and occasionally one will have a bad day and lash out. The team itself is amazing. It wasnt always the case though. When I started it was dysfunctional with very evil and sick people on board. It was very traumatic experience to make it work but we are an A team now.

Anyway, with that said it drains the hell out of me emotionally and mentally to keep it together. And Im ok with that because Im pretty good at recharging at home. However that usually involves being a potato and neglecting chores, neglecting help with responsibilites, and neglect giving my wife emotional support. Im just a very self absorbed person at home that just wants to recharge. I know its my job too because I never was like that before I took the red pill.

I am not ok with that, but I am also not ok with letting myself go at work so my team goes back to being dysfunctional and my reputation is shot.

So what do you do to balance it out? How do you stay charged enough to deal with the adult babies and then also still have enough charge to be a good spousal partner?

So,I just received notice that staff bonuses will not be delivered on the regular date of December 15th. My entire staff waits until that (late) date to buy presents for their families using bonus funds. I was told to “be gentle” in breaking this news but I know this will not be well received since our company is profitable right now. I can’t figure out why they aren’t paying bonuses on the usual schedule & upper management offered no explanation why there will be a delay. They also said there is no new date. Any advice? Should I just not say anything? I have no other info to tell them. They will be confused and crushed.

Don't try to be friends with the associates. Don't try to be the "Cool Manager." Don't try to be "The Manager you always wanted to have." Don't do it! Here's why.

I tried, and I was taken advantage of. I was also deeply disrespected. I'm currently being seen as nothing but a joke by my associates. I'm also often being treated like their secretary. It's not supposed to be that way.

Especially given the fact that I work in retail. Crappy customers come and go. But when you have less than pleasant associates, you're stuck all day with negativity. It will drive you nuts. Especially given all the responsibilities you have on top of everything else.

If you're reading this, and are hesitant to believe me, I get it. My whole story has been "this happened to me." And we're all different. But do yourself a favor, and ask the advice of other managers. This is common enough that I think you'll find most managers will agree.

There's a balance to it. Don't be a jerk. Don't power trip. But don't try to be the Cool Manager either. Hopefully this helps other new managers.

I have supervised teams for over 20 years and still struggle with a particular situation when it comes to employees.

It has to do with behavior that has been condoned by other managers in the past.

Last fall, I was moved to a team with the request from my managers to help create more professionalism in the work environment. One particular employee will vent loudly in the back room or on the operations floor. She will complain about company policy, management, other employees.

It is explained to me this way: "Maggie has a difficult time with her emotions and is dealing with past, personal trauma." This behavior has not been addressed in the past, either informally or formally.

I would like to address it as it not professional and has negatively impacted other team members. How do I best approach the situation?

I (36F) am fairly new on senior management for a small non-profit, and I feel so in over my head some days. I am learning a lot, but I am struggling. I only have 3 direct reports, but it feels like way more than that as I am constantly hearing issues and problems from all sides/angles. Everyone vents and complains, sometimes about operational issues, admin issues, other staff or even other senior managers. Today I felt like I heard 500 different issues before noon.

There is a lot of conflict, frustration and office politics , and it is exhausting and challenging to navigate. I am naturally introverted and while I think I am empathetic, a decent listener and solution focused, I am not the best at conflict management yet and get overwhelmed. I am finding myself completely exhausted by the time I get home some days and it has been very stressful lately.

Does it get any easier with time and experience? If you had to suggest one or two things/resources that helped you as a new manager what would they be?

This is our personal company invite, not a generic invite to a random conference.

Give me me pointers what to wear (male here) dress pants button down, no sports coat?

Also, what should I expect here? Yhey are paying us all to fly out and it last 3 or 4 days, at a very luxurious resort.

Can someone please elaborate of you have any experience with this?

We have a great team of 16 people and recently hired on someone for inside sales support.

One of my responsibilities is directing the inside sales team.

My team has always been fantastic, everyone works together, and things have been for the most part are great. We're busier than we have ever been and while times get stressful, we always are able to make it work with the same end goal. We are always helping each other.

This new inside support team member is just constantly complaining that they are "drowning". Myself and two other managers have offered support, held meetings to strategize managing workload and even offered to take things off this team members plate to help.

The problem is, we cannot exactly figure out what it is they are drowning with, nor can they tell us what exactly it is that is holding them down.

I have never had to micromanage staff before, but I recently have started to with this one, to try and wrap my head around what it is that is bogging this team member down, but they can never actually produce what it is that is causing them so much stress.

I am just at a loss of what to do next. They aren't as busy as they are claiming, nor are they letting us help them.

If I am busy and someone is offering to help me, I would take the help. They don't take any help offered but continue to tell team members how stressed they are and refuse projects from outside sales due to workload.

One of my biggest weaknesses is being empathetic and thinking I can work to change habits. Over the past year and a half I have tried my best to make it work with a staffer, even saving them from being cut loose twice already.

Today I delivered their termination with hr and I guess this is me coping with the stress and feeling of failure. I absolutely hate doing this, but it had to happen! This person finally became very insubordinate by telling some other staff members they don’t report to me. The no call no show 2 hours late sealed the deal this morning.

Anyway, thanks for reading.

For context I posted this last week.

https://reddit.com/r/managers/comments/130v62k/managers_do_i_need_to_join_in_fun_activities_if_i/

This week we had another mandatory 'dancercise' which I tried to reason with my manager that I simply don't feel comfortable doing it. I'm more than happy to watch and I even enjoy watching others have fun.. But for me I simply don't like it. She wasn't happy with my response.

A few days later she called me into her office and told me that 10 minutes of dancing a week isn't any harm and I'm "not being a team player" and she will find a way to get rid of me if I don't join in.

I'm pretty miserable about it. Even my colleagues agree with her.

We always hear about bad managers driving away good employees...but what about toxic employees driving away good managers? Seems like people forget that managers are human too.

First store manager job in a retail setting (I was McDonald's GM for about five years prior) I have an employee who I consider a "rockstar" as in they show up early and get their job done no questions asked. I recently recommended them for our career advancement program which they were overjoyed to participate in.

Lately I have noticed they have been overwhelmed with stuff going on in their personal life. I am starting to become genuinely concerned because while they put on a brave front while working, they have been calling me when they're off to vent about their stress. They have plenty of vacation time saved up (To the point some of it isn't going to carry over once FY ends). How should I go about recommending some PTO without looking like I am trying to force them out the door? I work with them Saturday morning and I am going to bring it up then.

Just got notified that I need to fire someone. This will be my first time. What makes it even more odd is it'll be the same day I planned to give my own notice. This will be a day.

(Why haven't I already given notice? Because I've had a vacation planned and didn't want to tell them "I quit and by the way, I have my vacation tomorrow." And no, my resignation would not save the person being let go.)

...on mostly work but some personal. It seems to be a personality thing.

Examples:

Laptop password

She forget her password and messaged me to say she was calling IT to fix it. I tell her it's no problem. She then carries on giving me unnecessary details about her call with IT, her laptop being old, it being the same password all along (I do not care).

Routine work

I ask her to prepare a file and she'll tell send me several messages telling me she's checked and this line is okay, then another line is okay, and another... I told her I don't need these updates and she can just tell me when the entire file is good to go.

Personal

She's having a kitchen replaced and it's been a nightmare. She updates me and our entire team any chance she gets. It has become a running joke in our team not to ask about this damned kitchen.

She also tells me and others about the details of her hospital appointment, health scare, etc. I'm fine to approve days off to take care of herself but she'll tell anyone that will listen about her doctors recommendations and so on.

I have brought it up in our 1-to-1s, but she quickly defaults back into this behaviour and cannot take a hint (I have been blunt and I also usually ignore the 5 messages of fluff but address 1 the reasonable question). She has gotten the reputation as an annoying waffler and people (particularly senior people) avoid dealing with her because of it.

Has anyone dealt with a similar employee?

I am a manager for a locally owned bakery in my city and I have been doing it for about a year and a half. It was fine at first as I had a lot of support for the owners, but as they have stepped away to work on other projects I have felt increasingly overwhelmed. Whenever staff complain about new policies in place or workplace procedures I feel so personally hurt over it. I try my best to be a great manager and to create a good work environment for others and I feel like I do, but it seems the reality is you can't make everyone happy. How do you personally not allow the stress of this to get the best of you?

I need some advice on an issue that happened today where I feel that an employee I managed acted disrespectful towards me.

So, every week we have a biweekly check run where we print checks based on what they're for. On this day we cut things such s city taxes, and housing utilities, or emergency checks. On our second check run is used for misc vendors. For the second check run the CFO tells us how much we need to spend(we work at a NP).

Today, an employee asked if we should be paying one of our various insurance companies. Generally these are reserved for Thursday, so I told her to hold off until we learned what we could spend for the second. Later she asked about paying a benefit package that was submitted late. Due to the amount owed, which wasn't much I said "yes" and I would take the hit if the bosses didn't like it. Later she, once again, asked about more insurance payments, and I told her to hold off on those as well.

Later, after the checks were printed, she ran into the CFO and asked if we should pay the insurance bills. He said we could because we had the money to do so. She then informed me the CFO said we could and I just said alright and she proceeded to print them.

Right now, I feel that was disrespectful and am not happy. This is someone who I've noticed doesn't listen to me at times, mostly due to asking the same, or similar questions, more than once. I don't necessarily think she had bad intentions and perhaps thought she was being helpful. However, it still feels like she either doesn't take, what I say seriously or is loosing respect for me.

Should I speak to my supervisor about this and later have a conversation with her? On one hand this feels like she was insubordinate. On the other hand, she could say that she was still giving permission and the CFO approved?

This is my first year as a manager. Previous years, I have received gifts from my managers (something nice but not outrageous, under $100). This year we are not allowed to expense gifts; I’m not certain if previous managers expensed gifts or if they paid out of pocket.

My team is globally dispersed, so finding something that is available for everyone locally or that could be shipped is difficult.

Not sure the etiquette or expectations.

The company I work for has thoroughly limited any form of "reward" we can offer our employees. Bonuses are not allowed. Additional time off is not allowed. Extra breaks are not allowed. Lunch won't be covered. No, you can't buy them a damned t-shirt either - because what if they're too hot or too cold in the t-shirt you provided and sue the company? Seriously.

Performance reports used to get folks raises, now a great performance report gets you an attaboy. A poor performance report though, and you bet you're in trouble.

The only thing I do have immediately at my disposal is a single day a week of WFH - usually.

So I'm trying to think outside the box. How can I reward excellent above-and-beyond work with little/no resources? Or perhaps I do have resources I'm not considering. I can tell them how much they're appreciated until I'm blue in the face, and admin seems to think that's a dandy reason for them to bust their butts - but my guess is they care for it about as much as I do when admin tells me how much they appreciate what I do.

Ideally the company would pick up on the fact that if you only offer baseline pay you'll only get baseline effort - but that's not where we are, so now I'm trying to polish this turd up as best I can.

Not a question, just an observation.

It took a Halloween costume contest to make this abundantly clear.

I am middle management, 1 department out of a dozen or so and all the department heads report to someone in upper management.

This morning we walk into our daily meeting to see the executive director dressed as the evil queen from snow white. I was not alone thinking, we'll that's appropriate. The executive director doesn't consider anyone's knowledge or experience. It's her way or the high way. I've experienced that from her first hand more than once.

If you knew everyone literally thought you were a witch, would you dress as one?

One of my reports asked for a promotion and a raise a year ago, both of which he deserves, and both - as he correctly pointed out - he can get fairly easily elsewhere. We pay ok, but are very stingy about promotions. I've put him up for promotions twice since then (supported by my boss), but they announced the latest round today and he's not on the list.

I'm not sure what to say to him. As a good corporate line manager it would be something like "keep it up, I'll keep submitting you and it will work out", although it probably won't. I once had a boss who told me she'd always work to help me in my career - even if it that was outside the company. But if I say that - and I want to - I may find myself outside the company, and not by own hand.

What's a good way of handling this one?

I work for a SaaS company in US and recently moved to CA for this job. I find the team leader (manager’s manager) to be very rude.

For example, I don’t have a car here cuz I just moved so I rely on public transportation which is really shitty. I am able to reach the office at 8:33 AM for a weekly meeting that starts at 8:30 AM. In reality it doesn’t start until the next 5-10mins because everyone’s pouring in, joining online or just taking time to settle. This has been the case since last 3-4 weeks. Before that I would reach super early (was paying for cabs every time).

Now in our meeting last week he tells me that I have an inclination towards being late (which I accept is my fault) but then he keeps mentioning this every time. Like we were talking about a project and he’s like “oh you wouldn’t know cuz you were late to the meeting”, which is not true cuz I’ve never missed the beginning of a meeting by being 3 mins late. It doesn’t even start until I reach.

This is just one example. Another example is when I cancelled a meeting because I didn’t have anything to get reviewed (which my manager suggested). This is ONE TIME in last 4 months. And he taunted me about this as well.

I believe that there’s a better way of communicating things. But I’d love to hear from y’all. Am in the over analyzing things?
